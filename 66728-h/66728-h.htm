<h3>CHAPTER I<br />


THE COUNTESS R&Eacute;MOND</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SELDEN, entering from the dining-room, saw
that the lounge was crowded, and he paused
for a moment to look about him. It was the
half-hour between dinner and the Sporting Club, and
he was pleasantly aware of the odours of good coffee
and super-excellent tobacco, mingled with the delicate
and very expensive perfumes rising from the
clothes, the hair, the shoulders of the women lying
indolently back in the deep chairs.</p>

<p>It was the women who dominated the scene.
There were men present, to be sure, but they were
as unobtrusive to the eye, as strictly utilitarian, as
the donor kneeling humbly in the corner of the picture
before the madonna he had paid to have
painted.</p>

<p>These men were donors, too, of many things besides
paint&mdash;but the resemblance ended there. For
there was nothing madonna-like about the women.
They differed in being blonde or brune, of various
contours, and of all ages, but some subtle quality of
spirit bound them together in a common sisterhood.
Their gowns ran the gamut of the rainbow and were
of every material and degree of eccentricity, but a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
common purpose underlay them all. Every neck
bore its rope of pearls, every hand its clustered diamonds.</p>

<p>Tributes to beauty, one might suppose&mdash;but not
at all. The treasures of the Rue de la Paix, the
choicest creations of Cartier, had been showered
upon beauty and ugliness alike&mdash;if there was any
difference, beauty had the worst of it. Indeed most
of these women were anything but beautiful. There
were some who were still slim, who still had youth
and a certain charm; there were two or three of an
incredible seductiveness, more dazzling than the brilliants
on their fingers; but for the most part they
were fat, raddled, unspeakably vulgar, gazing out at
the world from between darkened lashes with eyes
unutterably weary and disillusioned.</p>

<p>They were not all courtesans. The trophies so
lavishly displayed were, in part at least, the spoils
of marriage; but, virtuous or vicious, their worlds
moved in the same orbit, with the same purpose, toward
the same end.</p>

<p>Was it one of these women, Selden wondered,
who had summoned him to a rendezvous? He told
himself that he was foolish to have come, that he
should have known better, and he had an impulse to
pass on without stopping. Yet something about the
note which had been handed in to him as he was
dressing for dinner had piqued his curiosity, and
piqued it still:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If Mr. Selden will be in the lounge at 9:45 this evening,
he will not only give one of his debtors an opportunity
to express her gratitude, but will learn something
that may prove of interest.</p>
</div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>The writing was unusually firm and characteristic.
He was quite sure that he had never seen it before.
And it was not in the least sentimental, but decidedly
of the world. It was this which persuaded him to
come. It is pleasant to have one&#8217;s services acknowledged,
and he was always willing to be interested.
More than once he had been started on a
profitable trail in some such unusual fashion. On
the other hand, should it prove merely an attempt at
intrigue, an advance on the part of some impecunious
lady who had secured his name from the chasseur,
it would be easy enough to withdraw&mdash;he had only
to explain the state of his finances! So here he was.</p>

<p>He saw that the divan to the right of the fireplace
was unoccupied, threaded his way to it among the
chairs and tables and over outstretched feet, and
asked the waiter for coffee. He lighted a cigarette
and glanced at his watch. It was 9:40.</p>

<p>The fire had a welcome warmth, for he had still
in his bones the chill of unheated Austria, from which
he had arrived only that morning, and he leaned forward,
elbows on knees, and stretched out his hands
to it. Indeed it was principally to get warm again
that he had come to Monte Carlo.</p>

<p>But the chill was in his heart, too; and he shivered
a little at thought of the pinched, blue faces, the
hopeless eyes....</p>

<p>He was suddenly conscious that some one was
standing beside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Selden?&#8221; said a voice.</p>

<p>In an instant he was on his feet, bowing above the
hand that was held out to him.</p>

<p>His first impression was of that hand, long, nervous,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
but giving the assurance of strength in reserve&mdash;just
the hand to have produced the writing of the
note. His next was of the eyes, extraordinarily
vivid under level brows; with iris so distended that
they seemed quite black, though he was afterwards
to see that they were a dark green shot with yellow.</p>

<p>&#8220;How happy I am to see you again!&#8221; she said in
a clear voice, for the benefit of the idly-observant
room, withdrew her hand and sank into a corner of
the seat. &#8220;Please get me some coffee,&#8221; she added,
&#8220;and give me a cigarette.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes met his, as he held the match for her,
and a twinkle of amusement sprang into them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your sister is well, I hope?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Let
me see&mdash;it has been two years, almost, since I last
saw her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is quite well, thank you,&#8221; answered Selden,
who by this time had pulled himself together, and
was quite ready to accept a hypothetical sister. &#8220;She
is to be married next month,&#8221; he added, as a slight
contribution to the game.</p>

<p>&#8220;How interesting! To an American? But of
course. Tell me about it!&#8221; And then, as the waiter
served the coffee and passed on, she moved closer to
him and dropped her voice. &#8220;I do not wonder that
you are astonished! Confess that I am not in the
least what you expected!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never expected to be so fortunate,&#8221; countered
Selden, and permitted himself to appraise her.</p>

<p>There could be no question that she was most unusual&mdash;she
would be striking anywhere with her coal-black
hair, her long pale face, her vivid eyes and lips;
striking too in the way she was dressed, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
ornament, in a narrow Lanvin gown of black which
seemed to be part of her, to be moulded to her as a
snake&#8217;s skin is moulded. Then, at second glance,
Selden saw there was one ornament&mdash;a queer stone
of greenish-yellow, matching her eyes, catching her
gown together across the curve of her breasts. But
there were no pearls, no brilliants, not a single ring
on her long fingers. Selden wondered if there were
also no donor.</p>

<p>She took the coffee that he offered her and leaned
back again in her corner. As she sipped it slowly,
she looked across at him with level eyes, and Selden
realized that she was also appraising him. He had
known at once, of course, that he had never seen
her before, and her glance seemed to indicate that
he was equally unknown to her. A dozen questions
sprang to his lips, but he held them back. It was
for her to begin. And he was not quite sure of her
status. A woman of position, evidently; but as he
looked at her he wondered whether the vividness of
eyes and lips, the even pallor of the face, owed something&mdash;a
very tiny something!&mdash;to art. If so, it
was consummate art, such as one meets nowhere outside
of France. As for her age,&mdash;but he hesitated
even to venture a guess.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have wanted to know you for a long time, Mr.
Selden,&#8221; she said softly at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;You honour me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The historian of the war, the interpreter of the
peace conference, the champion of the League of
Nations, the saviour of Central Europe!&#8221; she went
on.</p>

<p>Selden stiffened a little, on guard against this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
irony. There was upon her lips the merest shadow
of a smile which might mean anything.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem extraordinarily well informed,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I hear people talk, and you would be surprised,
I think, to know how often your name is
mentioned. I have even read some of your articles.
You write rather well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Selden. &#8220;I am always striving
to improve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides,&#8221; she added, &#8220;you are, in a way, a
curiosity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, in many ways!&#8221; he protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are the only man I know,&#8221; she went on,
leaning toward him, &#8220;who has not lost hope. Every
one else sees only shipwreck and disaster, but you do
not seem to see that at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; agreed Selden, &#8220;I don&#8217;t. I see three hundred
million people freed of century-old shackles
and struggling toward the light.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was silent a moment&mdash;then she glanced around
the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can see that even here?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is rather difficult,&#8221; he admitted, following her
glance. &#8220;But after all, these people are of no importance&mdash;they
are just wasters, slackers, headed for
death. Just the same,&#8221; he added, and stopped.</p>

<p>She laughed a little at the way he shut his jaws.</p>

<p>&#8220;Swear if you wish to!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinking of some things I saw in Vienna
and southern Poland not long ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again she gave him a long glance, as though wondering
whether she could trust him. He was rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
a queer-looking fellow, with a long, smooth-shaven
face, weather-beaten and deeply lined, but the steel-grey
eyes looked out steadily from under the heavy
lashes, and there was something in the set of the jaw
that won confidence. It was a powerful jaw, with
muscles that bunched up into little ridges on either
side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been to Goritza recently?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was there last month.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you meet the new ruler?&#8221; The question
was asked indolently, almost carelessly, but there
was in the voice a little quiver which struck Selden&#8217;s
ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean the president&mdash;Jeneski? Yes; he
gave me an interview.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you think of him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought him a remarkable man,&#8221; said Selden,
looking at her and wondering if it was to ask these
questions she had summoned him here.</p>

<p>&#8220;But impractical, a dreamer, I have been told,&#8221;
she supplemented.</p>

<p>&#8220;Impractical in some ways, perhaps,&#8221; Selden conceded;
&#8220;a little of a fanatic, as all reformers must
be, to get anything done. But an electrical man&mdash;full
of fire and energy, discouraged by nothing. He
is greatly handicapped by the poverty of the country
and the ignorance of the people. They are having
a hard time to get along, but at least they have
got rid of the medi&aelig;val dynasty which kept them
in slavery for two hundred years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it as bad as that?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;The old king meant well enough, and had his
good moments, but he was an absolute despot. Nobody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
could question his will&mdash;there was nothing to
hope for. Now they are free.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And happy of course?&#8221; she commented, her lip
curling a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is difficult to be happy on an empty stomach.
If Jeneski had two or three million dollars....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But since he has not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they must go to work and earn it, and be
glad they have something to work for and look forward
to. There are a lot of royalists left, of course,&#8221;
Selden added, &#8220;who lament the good old days, and
would like to see Jeneski overthrown. There is the
old nobility and all the hangers-on who made money
out of the court, and who are now as poor as anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So some day, perhaps, there will be a restoration?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think so. Restorations are expensive.
The royalists haven&#8217;t any money, and the old
king is quite bankrupt. I admire him for one thing,
though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jeneski told me they had offered him half a million
dollars to renounce the throne, and he refused
it&mdash;said that no king could renounce his throne, any
more than he could renounce his right hand or the
colour of his hair&mdash;not those words, of course, but
that was the idea. Good old medi&aelig;val, divine right
stuff!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like him for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I, and I&#8217;m going to try to see him. He&#8217;s
staying somewhere along the Riviera, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, at Nice.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>&#8220;Jeneski spoke also of the former prime minister&mdash;a
very able man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;the Baron Lappo. He is with the king, I
believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So Jeneski said. He tried to detach him, but it
was no use. Lappo is devoted to the dynasty. And
of course they have some plot in hand. Well, if it
amuses them,&#8221; and Selden shrugged his shoulders.
&#8220;But they would better make haste. In six months
it will be too late&mdash;Jeneski will have his people with
him. Does the king keep up a court over here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know, but I have been told he lives very
simply.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you happen to know his grandson, the crown
prince Danilo?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have seen him&mdash;he is often at the Sporting
Club.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A great gambler, I have heard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is in the blood,&#8221; said the girl, with a little
shrug. &#8220;His father was killed in a duel that followed
a night of play.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden looked at her again. She seemed well informed
about other things besides himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever been to Goritza?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was born there,&#8221; she answered quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Born there?&#8221; he echoed. &#8220;But you&mdash;you....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; she asked, smiling at his astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look like a Parisienne, and you talk like an
American!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was taken to America when I was a child, and
grew up there,&#8221; she explained.</p>

<p>He waited for her to go on, to elucidate the atmosphere
of Paris, but she seemed lost in thought.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
Once he fancied her eyes wandered toward the door,
as though she were expecting some one. There was
some work he had planned to do that evening&mdash;work
he really ought to do. Besides, an explanation
was undoubtedly due him, and it was time she made
it. In spite of himself, he stirred nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit still a moment longer,&#8221; she laughed, perceiving
the movement.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I am not offended&mdash;I know how restless
Americans are. And I know what is in your mind:
you have some work to do. It is always so with an
American. But I have not yet told you why I wished
to see you. In the first place, I desired to thank you
for a very great service&mdash;the greatest service a man
can render a woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Was she in earnest, Selden wondered? She certainly
seemed so, and he tried to think what the
greatest service was a man could render a woman.
There were so many services&mdash;besides, it depended
on the woman&mdash;and also on the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it is a riddle, I give it up,&#8221; he said. &#8220;How
could I render you a service? I have never seen
you before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;nor I you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was the service?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You rid me of a husband I hated.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden leaned back in his corner and put the
thought of work definitely behind him. He had not
expected anything like this.</p>

<p>&#8220;That <i>is</i> interesting,&#8221; he commented. &#8220;You mean
I&mdash;ah&mdash;put him out of the way?&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded, her lips quivering.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Selden, &#8220;it would be foolish for
me to deny that I have a long list of assassinations
to my credit. But I do not seem to recall this particular
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think the date will bring it back to your mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was the date?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her face was ashen, and her eyes burned into his.
Could it be that she was in earnest?</p>

<p>&#8220;The sixth of June, 1918,&#8221; she said hoarsely.</p>

<p>Selden contracted his brows in an effort to remember
where he had been on the sixth of June, 1918.
That was two years and a half ago, and so much
had happened; the sixth of June&mdash;yes, of course&mdash;that
was a day he would remember all his life. At
dawn, he had watched the Marines straighten out
their line toward Torcy, and late in the afternoon
he had seen them go forward against Belleau Wood
and Bouresches. He remembered the thrill with
which he had learned of the order for the attack&mdash;we
were going in at last! And he had hurried out of
headquarters and clambered up to a little red-roofed
farm-house looking down on Belleau....</p>

<p>But what connection could all this have with the
woman beside him?</p>

<p>And then his face stiffened at a sudden recollection.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean,&#8221; he stammered, &#8220;you can&#8217;t possibly
mean that you were the wife....&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded, white to the lips. Then suddenly her
face changed, the blood rushed back into it, and she
was smiling gaily.</p>

<p>Selden, more astonished than ever, looked around
to see two men approaching, one old and rather fat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
but with a keen, distinguished face, embellished by a
monocle; the other young and slim, thirty at the
most, perhaps less than that....</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear countess!&#8221; cried the elder man, in French,
and raised her hand and kissed it. &#8220;I have been
searching for you everywhere. Permit me to present
to you Prince Danilo. My prince,&#8221; he added, turning
to the young man, &#8220;this is the Countess R&eacute;mond,
of whom you have heard me so often speak.&#8221;</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<h3>CHAPTER II<br />


A TRAGIC MEMORY</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS the prince bowed, with much empressement,
above the slim hand extended to him, Selden
was conscious of a rapid but penetrating
scrutiny on the part of the older man. It was as if
an X-ray had been plunged into the innermost recesses
of his being, photographed everything that was
to be seen there, and been instantly withdrawn.
He had never seen more remarkable eyes&mdash;which
was perhaps why their owner ambushed one of them
behind a glass; nor a more remarkable face, alert,
high-nosed, finely coloured, with a mouth at once
forceful and good-humoured, and an air that bespoke
wide knowledge and deep experience.</p>

<p>&#8220;Enchanted to meet you, madame,&#8221; the prince
was murmuring in the most approved fashion. &#8220;It
is true that the baron has spoken often of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;M. le Baron does me too much honour,&#8221; protested
the countess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible, madame,&#8221; countered the baron. &#8220;To
prove to you how much in earnest I am, I have come
all the way from Nice expressly to pay you my respects,
having learned only this morning, quite by
accident, that you were here. Why did you not inform
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; murmured the countess, &#8220;I know how busy
you always are!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>&#8220;So it remained for me to learn it I know not
how&mdash;a voice on the Promenade des Anglais, a bit
of gossip at the casino, a line in the Petit Ni&ccedil;ois,&mdash;&#8216;The
Countess R&eacute;mond is at the Hotel de Paris.&#8217;
At least, I lost no time. I had my man confirm it
over the telephone; unhappily you were out, so I
could make no engagement. But I came just the
same, and brought the prince with me, hoping to be
so fortunate as to find you free for the evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it you propose?&#8221; asked the countess, who
had listened to all this laughingly, yet with a certain
curious intentness, as though seeking to find in it
somewhere a code, a key, a hidden meaning.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was going to propose the opera&mdash;&#8216;Tosca&#8217;&mdash;you
have, of course, heard it many times; but there
is a new tenor, an American. Afterwards the club,
Ciro&#8217;s&mdash;what you wish. But if you are engaged,&#8221;
and his eyes rested fleetingly upon Selden.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is M. Selden,&#8221; said the countess; &#8220;an old
friend of mine in America, whom I found sitting
here a moment ago, quite by accident. M. Selden,
this is Prince Danilo of Goritza, and the Baron
Lappo, counsellor of kings, and also an old friend
of mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Counsellor of one king, only, monsieur,&#8221; corrected
the baron; &#8220;I find it enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have heard of M. Selden,&#8221; added the countess;
&#8220;you, at least, baron, who read everything. It
was he who wrote those articles in the <i>London Times</i>
about our new republic. They must have annoyed
you deeply!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, they did!&#8221; agreed the baron, smiling. &#8220;I
liked the ones on Austria much better&mdash;you must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
permit me, monsieur, to congratulate you on a splendid
piece of work. There we see eye to eye. And
let me add that I am happy indeed to meet you.
You will perhaps give me an opportunity to expose
my point of view.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is exactly what I hoped, M. le Baron,&#8221; said
Selden. &#8220;I was saying to madame but a moment
since that I must try to see the king.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that can be arranged. He will welcome the
opportunity. I will let you know.&#8221; The baron
paused a moment and looked him over with a quizzical
smile. &#8220;You are a great republican, hein?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;I also, in theory, though perhaps you will
not believe it. It is true&mdash;but not for my country;
no, there I am a monarchist. I do not believe our
people are ready for a republic. In another generation,
perhaps, but not now. They require education&mdash;but
we will talk of all that some other time. Perhaps
you would care to hear &#8216;La Tosca&#8217; once again?
I have a box&mdash;I should be most happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Selden; &#8220;but I have some
work to do. Even at Monte Carlo I try to do a
little.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you Americans!&#8221; murmured the baron. &#8220;It
is no wonder you own the world! I will speak to
the king to-morrow. You shall hear from me. You
are staying at this hotel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, M. le Baron. And thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Au revoir,&#8221; said the countess, and held out her
hand. &#8220;I am so glad to have seen you again, and
I shall not forget our engagement for to-morrow.
At twelve, shall we say?&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden was quick to bow assent.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>&#8220;At twelve,&#8221; he agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Till to-morrow, then,&#8221; said the countess, and
moved away, the plump but altogether distinguished
baron on one side and the tall, rather commonplace
prince on the other.</p>

<p>A strange trio, Selden told himself, as he stood
for a moment looking after them&mdash;at the graceful
lines of the woman&#8217;s figure; at the baron&#8217;s head, with
its grey hair parted down the back after the ancient
manner; at the prince&#8217;s negligent walk and careless
air&mdash;a little too careless, perhaps, to be quite genuine.
And yet perhaps not, for the face was careless
too, with its dark skin and shining eyes and sensuous
mouth; not a bad face, but rather a weak one, as of
a man who no longer found any cause worth fighting
for.</p>

<p>They had paused a moment to get some wraps
from the vestiaire, and the countess looked back at
him and smiled. Then they passed through the door
together, and Selden, shaking himself out of his
thoughts, betook himself to his room. There he
changed into an old dressing-gown and disreputable
slippers, got his pipe to going, sat down at his desk
and plunged resolutely into the article he was finishing
for the <i>Times</i>. Long practice had perfected his
ability to switch his mind at will from one subject
to another, and for the hour that followed he was
not at Monte Carlo but at Neustadt in central
Austria, witnessing the loading of a long Red Cross
train with half-starved children to be taken away
into Switzerland to be fed. It was the only way to
save them&mdash;no one realized that better than their
mothers&mdash;but there had been scenes.... For to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
many of the women these pale little wraiths were all
that the war had left them.</p>

<p>He leaned back at last with a sigh of satisfaction;
then got his manuscript together, looked it over,
made a correction here and there, sealed it up, addressed
it, summoned the porter and sent it off.
That done, he filled his pipe again, stretched out on
the chaise-longue and allowed his mind to wander
back over the events of the evening.</p>

<p>A strange trio. Each remarkable&mdash;especially the
baron. To talk with him would be worth while.
His point of view was certain to be interesting&mdash;and
might, after all, be the right one. As for the prince,
he seemed to be little more than a puppet in the
baron&#8217;s hands&mdash;he had certainly given the impression
of being led around&mdash;led up to the countess to
be introduced, led to the opera. Perhaps that was
the price he paid for freedom in other directions&mdash;and
crown princes were destined to be puppets, more
or less! As for the countess, evidently a woman of
the world, wise in its ways, refined in its furnace&mdash;but
also a little hardened. Curious how, when the
baron was speaking, she seemed always to be watching
for her cue.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was really a drama that was preparing,
with these three for the protagonists. And perhaps
he too would have a part&mdash;a minor one, of course;
but to be behind the scenes would be something.
That was where he loved to be, behind the scenes,
not involved in the action but free to watch the
strings that worked the puppets and to try to trace
them to their controlling source. It was great luck&mdash;too
good to be true! He was letting his imagination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
run away with him. But how else explain the
sudden interest of the Countess R&eacute;mond? To suppose
that she had summoned him to a rendezvous
merely to thank him&mdash;that was absurd! She would
not waste her time like that. No; there was some
other purpose, and the baron and the prince had arrived
at a most inopportune moment, for she was
just upon the verge of explanation. Or had she
been expecting them all the while? Was that why
her eyes had sought the door?</p>

<p>And this engagement for to-morrow which she
had suddenly evolved? What did that mean?</p>

<p>Well, to-morrow would tell!</p>

<p>But he realized that he had need to be on guard.
He recalled her strange face, her burning eyes, her
vivid mouth. Who was she? What was she? A
woman with a furnace inside her. No novice, certainly.
But neither was he a novice! A fierce
woman&mdash;how her face had hardened when she had
mentioned that date&mdash;the sixth of June, 1918!</p>

<p>Selden&#8217;s hardened, too, for he was not likely ever
to forget the happenings of that day&mdash;one happening
in particular.</p>

<p>At two o&#8217;clock in the afternoon, in the old farm-house
which had been the home of some quiet peasant
family for a hundred years, but which was now
the headquarters of General Harbord, commanding
the Marine brigade of the Second Division, he had
seen an order typed off which marked the beginning
of the American offensive. It was an order that at
five o&#8217;clock the Marines should advance against Belleau
Wood and the village of Bouresches. The Marines
had taken over their present positions from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
the French only a few hours before, and the Germans
would count on their waiting to get settled
before doing any attacking. Therefore there was
every reason to expect the advantage of surprise.
In any event, as General Harbord remarked, the
way to act in an active sector was to be active.</p>

<p>Copies were made of the order and a minute later
two dispatch bearers were pounding away toward
the lines to convey them to the regimental commanders.
Selden, tingling with excitement, resolved
to watch the advance from the very best position discoverable,
and for the next hour scouted up and down
behind the lines. He found, at last, a place which
seemed ideal, a tiny farm-house with red-tiled roof
partially blown away, looking down from a little
knoll upon both wood and village. He assured himself
that the place was deserted and that there was
a ladder by which he could reach the roof, then
walked over to the little orchard and lay down in
the shade to rest.</p>

<p>He must have dozed, for he was roused suddenly
by a clatter of explosions. The beginning of the attack,
he told himself, and then, as he started to rise,
saw a motor-cycle wheel swiftly into the yard beside
the house and stop. The rider, whom he recognized
as one of the couriers from headquarters,
sprang to the ground, and, after a quick look around,
entered the house. He was out again in a moment,
gathering up some bits of wood and dried grass,
which he took back into the house. Then he drew a
cupful of gasolene from the tank of his motor-cycle
and hurried into the house again.</p>

<p>Selden, watching motionless, told himself bitterly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
that he would have to seek another vantage point&mdash;evidently
this place was going to be used by the
army. He would inquire&mdash;and he was just rising to
his feet when he was astounded to see a thin column
of smoke rising from the chimney. The day was
windless and the smoke rose straight into the air.
Then suddenly it stopped&mdash;started again&mdash;stopped&mdash;started
again. Five distinct puffs floated upward
toward the sky, then the smoke stopped for good,
and a moment later the dispatch rider emerged,
flung himself into the saddle and was off.</p>

<p>Selden lay staring after him, trying to understand.
It had been a signal, of course, but to whom? To
our men? But why use so clumsy a method, when
there were telephones everywhere? To the Germans?
The thought brought him bounding to his
feet, and in another moment he was racing down
the hill. But he lost his way in a strip of woods; he
ran into a deep ravine, which delayed him; and then
into a stretch of bog, around which he had to work
his way, and even as he panted up the road toward
headquarters, the earth burst asunder with the
thunder of the artillery preparation.</p>

<p>General Harbord listened to the gasped-out story
with a face of granite, and called his chief of staff.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have we time to stop the attack?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible, sir,&#8221; said the chief. &#8220;There is just
a minute and a half. We should only disorganize
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they sat and waited&mdash;through a minute which
seemed like an hour&mdash;and then the reports came
pouring in&mdash;of the massed machine-gun fire which
had greeted the attack at the very outset, of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
rifles waiting in the woods; oh, yes, our men had
gone on, but the casualties were very heavy, especially
among the officers&mdash;yes, Colonel Catlin too.
The Germans had seemed to know the very minute
to expect them....</p>

<p>There was a brief trial, late that night, and a
swift conviction. The accused had denied nothing,
admitted nothing&mdash;merely shrugging his shoulders
as he listened to Selden&#8217;s story and realized the game
was up&mdash;asking only that he might write a letter to
his wife; and at dawn a firing-squad had ended the
affair.</p>

<p>Selden had, of course, not seen the letter, but it
shocked him now to think that the woman to whom
the man wrote that night was the lovely being who
had summoned him to a rendezvous. He had made
no inquiries&mdash;indeed, had sought to drop the whole
sordid incident out of his consciousness. But now
he began to wonder who the man really was. How
had he managed to win this gorgeous woman?
What had he said in the letter?</p>

<p>The censor, of course, would permit him to say
little except good-bye; certainly he would not permit
him to mention Selden&#8217;s name, or even to refer to
him indirectly. Most probably the letter had never
been sent at all&mdash;had been simply turned over to the
intelligence department. But, in that case, how had
she known? In any case, how had she known?</p>

<p>The thought brought him bolt upright. It would
have been wiser to keep that strange trio under observation.
He had been wrong to yield to the feeling
that he was in the way. That the baron had
come to Monte Carlo merely to pay his respects and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
introduce the prince Selden did not for an instant
believe&mdash;and what place better than an opera box
for a discreet talk? Decidedly he should have gone
along!</p>

<p>Perhaps it was not yet too late. He glanced at
his watch&mdash;yes, eleven forty-five&mdash;the opera was
over. But there remained Ciro&#8217;s and the Sporting
Club....</p>

<p>In another instant, he was kicking off his slippers
and reaching for his shoes.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III<br />


A DUO AT THE OPERA</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE opera at Monte Carlo is housed in the
end of the Casino building nearest the Hotel
de Paris, so that the Countess R&eacute;mond and
her two companions had only to cross the street. It
was to the private entrance that the baron led the
way. Here the prince paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you require me any longer?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you would better go in and be seen with
us for a moment,&#8221; said the baron.</p>

<p>The prince nodded curtly, and the three followed
a deferential, gold-laced flunkey up the red-carpeted
stair, and into a box.</p>

<p>It is a masterpiece of its kind, this opera house,
the work of that Charles Garnier who built the Paris
opera, and whose style, if too gay and florid for a
temple dedicated to the classics, is admirably suited
to the frivolous atmosphere of Monte Carlo.
Outside it is a medley of columns, mosaics, lyres,
masks and minarets; inside, of gilding, garlands,
friezes and frescoes. Vigorous young women support
the domed ceiling, naked youths perch precariously
on the cornices; one is confused and intimidated
by the riot of colour and decoration. But
gradually one gets used to it, and the auditorium itself
is admirable&mdash;a single floor of comfortable seats
stretching below the boxes down to the stage.</p>

<p>There are three large boxes, the central one, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
gilded canopy, being reserved for Monaco&#8217;s Prince.
It was into one of the others that the baron&#8217;s party
was shown; and the baron, after assisting the countess
to a seat, himself sat down and looked out across
the audience toward the stage. The prince refused
the chair proffered by the attendant, and stood leaning
against the side of the box as though poised for
flight.</p>

<p>The play had proceeded to the second act, and
Scarpia was explaining his evil designs to Tosca,
while her lover was being melodiously tortured off-stage.
The baron looked only long enough to see
that Della Rizza was singing Tosca and Dinh-Gilly
Scarpia, and then, having heard them many times,
he turned his attention from the stage to the
audience.</p>

<p>This audience, with the reputation of being the
most blas&eacute; in the world, was lolling in its seats,
listening perfunctorily to the music, and almost
visibly digesting a too-generous dinner. Not until
Scarpia had died, with a last convulsion, and Tosca
had placed the candles on either side of his head,
and the curtain had come down and the lights gone
up, did it stir. Then it rose to its feet as by a common
impulse and surged forth into the pillared
atrium to walk up and down and get a little gentle
exercise and look itself over.</p>

<p>But the baron did not rise. Instead he drew his
chair further back into the recesses of the box.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go, my prince,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and take a look at the
ladies. Only, I pray you, do not enter the rooms.
I have an affair of importance to discuss with our
dear countess.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>The prince disappeared in an instant and the
baron leaned back with a sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he were only more serious,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but he
resembles that great-great-uncle for whom he was
named&mdash;intelligent, generous, but entirely mad when
it comes to women and games of chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His father was also a little like that, was he
not?&#8221; asked the countess, with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;it is true,&#8221; and the baron sighed again;
&#8220;but he was also more earnest, more interested in
affairs of state. It was a great blow to the king
when he was killed&mdash;suddenly&mdash;like that&mdash;his eldest
son. He knew nothing about it until they came
bringing the body. Now all his hopes are centred in
this boy, who causes us so many anxieties.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is still young,&#8221; the countess pointed out;
&#8220;and he is at least discreet&mdash;one hears nothing of
his love affairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, there at least we have been fortunate,&#8221; said
the baron. &#8220;For some years now there has been only
one. It has grown more serious than I like, yet it is
far better than the ruinous affairs in which he might
have been involved. But to the gambling there is
no end as long as he can find a sou in his pocket.
He has a sort of vertigo when he sees the tables,
with the wheels going round and the banknotes falling
here and there and the croupiers calling the numbers&mdash;a
vertigo, that is how he describes it. Fortunately
at present he has no money and I know no
one of whom he can borrow. His debts, I think,
have reached the limit. There is perhaps some comfort
in that!&#8221; he added grimly.</p>

<p>During this discourse, as before that evening, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
countess listened as though waiting for a cue and
finding none.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you send for me?&#8221; she asked abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I have need of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course&mdash;but in what way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are preparing to place the king back on his
throne.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shrugged sceptically.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I take it for granted,&#8221; went on the baron,
with a sudden unveiling of his eyes, &#8220;that you would
not be sorry to see Jeneski punished&mdash;his work undone,
his dream broken.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her face was livid as she returned his look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said thickly, &#8220;I should be glad of
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought so,&#8221; said the baron, and polished his
glass abstractedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not impossible&mdash;it is all but arranged. One
little impulse more and it is done. You will supply
that impulse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I warn you,&#8221; said the countess, &#8220;that I shall have
to know everything before I consent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall know everything,&#8221; agreed the baron;
&#8220;and furthermore I can promise you, if we succeed,
not only&mdash;shall we say satisfaction?&mdash;but a material
reward&mdash;a substantial one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can speak of that later,&#8221; said the countess,
&#8220;after I have consented. But why do you come to
me? What is it I can do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I come to you,&#8221; replied the baron, &#8220;in the first
place because you are a clever woman, and in the
second place because you have lived in America for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
a long time, and I suppose you understand that people.
As for me, I confess I never do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean the women?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But naturally. The men&mdash;they are not difficult
to understand. Though I sometimes wonder if they
can really be as simple as they appear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are,&#8221; said the countess. &#8220;Children. Bad
ones, sometimes, but still children, good at heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They seem so to me,&#8221; agreed the baron.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it is not this M. Selden?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;though he is important also. Unfortunately
at this moment it is the question of a woman&mdash;two
women&mdash;perhaps even three women! It is a
difficult matter&mdash;very difficult; but there is one thing
that simplifies it&mdash;one of these women is very ambitious
and very ignorant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That goes without saying,&#8221; commented the countess,
&#8220;if she is a rich American. But if you will
cease speaking in riddles....&#8221;</p>

<p>The baron laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is the history,&#8221; he said; &#8220;it is a peculiar
one, such as could happen nowhere but in America.
This woman, when she was quite young, worked as
a waitress in a public restaurant at a place in the
western part of the United States called Denver.
She met there one day a young man who was a miner,
married him and went back with him into the mountains
to search for gold. That was admirable, was
it not? They kept searching for a long time, and
they did not find any gold, but at last they found
copper&mdash;a mountain of it. My informant tells me
that this is not an exaggeration&mdash;that it was really
a mountain, though it is there no longer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>&#8220;This young man had no money, and to develop
a mine of copper, even when you have it all together
in one mountain, takes a great deal. For a long
time nobody believed his story about this mountain,
but at last he secured enough money from some men
in Denver to build a little mill. But it was not
profitable, partly because it was far from the
market and the railroad would not extend itself
for such a small mill, but principally because it was
necessary to pay so high wages to the men who
worked the mill. It was very hard to get any men
at all, and they could charge what they pleased. So
the mill had to be closed, and it looked as though the
man had failed&mdash;that he would have to sell his
mountain for a very small sum. The years were
passing; neither the man nor the woman were as
young as they had been&mdash;especially the woman. She
had had two children. She was discouraged. She
wanted him to sell. But he would not.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now regard how strange are the ways of providence.
One day a young man came to him and said,
&#8216;I hear you cannot work your mill because labour is
so dear.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;That is so,&#8217; said the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Then I have a proposal to make. I have some
friends in the country from which I come, strong, active
young men like myself, who wish to come to
America, but who have no money. If you will bring
them to America, they will work for you for two
years and you will give them but to eat and sleep.
After that, we will arrange a fair wage.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh bien, the man raised money enough to bring
to America twenty of these young men, and they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
went to work for him. They worked well, and soon
twenty more were brought over, and then fifty more,
and then a hundred more. At the end of five years,
a little city had grown up at the foot of that mountain
of copper, and the man who had made the proposal
to bring over the first ones governed it. And
all the men in that city came from my country.&#8221;</p>

<p>The baron paused for a moment to enjoy the start
of surprise which the countess could not wholly repress.</p>

<p>&#8220;So it is that story you are telling me!&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I go on?&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded and settled a little farther back into
the shadow.</p>

<p>&#8220;The people were well treated,&#8221; continued the
baron. &#8220;They lived better than they had ever lived;
they saved money and sent it home that their families
might join them. But beyond everything, they piled
up a great, an enormous fortune for the man who
had discovered the mountain. And his wife soon
forgot that she had at one time worked in a restaurant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; murmured the countess, with a strange
smile; &#8220;and her children never knew it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps so,&#8221; agreed the baron, searching her
face with his keen eyes. &#8220;I do not know. But at
last we began to suspect that we had been wrong to
permit so many of our young men to go to America
to work for this man of copper, though we had been
glad enough at the time, since we had no work for
them at home. But they were always writing back
about America, about how well things were there&mdash;about
liberty! Some of them came back from time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
to time and talked too much and too wildly. The
climax which we should have foreseen came at last.
A bomb was thrown at the king.&#8221;</p>

<p>The baron paused as though to contemplate&mdash;to
say a prayer before&mdash;an act so terrible, so sacrilegious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Continue, my friend,&#8221; encouraged the countess.
&#8220;I find this history immensely entertaining.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt you already know most of it,&#8221; suggested
the baron.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even if I do, it gains new interest from your
manner of telling. Please go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As for the rest, I will be brief. We found that
that bomb had been thrown by a man who had come
back from America expressly for that purpose. He
said so, quite frankly. He told us that another
would succeed where he had failed&mdash;that our country
was to be made a republic like America. We
laughed and hanged him&mdash;but it gave us to think.
So we sent agents to America. They unearthed for
us the history which I have just recounted, and they
found it was indeed true that over there they were
plotting against us. Their leader&mdash;the man who
ruled them, who organized them, who collected their
money, who furnished all the brains&mdash;was a radical,
an anarchist, who, fifteen years before, had been
forced to flee from Goritza for his life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And who is now the president of the new republic,&#8221;
broke in the countess. &#8220;In a word, Jeneski.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true; the world sometimes seems to me to
be upside down,&#8221; and the baron rubbed a puzzled
hand over his head. &#8220;I do not yet know how it happened&mdash;but
in those last days of the war, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
everything was falling to pieces, but when we
thought ourselves firmly re-established, he suddenly
appeared, won over what was left of the army, and
in an hour we were fleeing for the frontier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With the crown jewels and the contents of the
treasury,&#8221; said the countess.</p>

<p>The baron smiled a deprecatory smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;The treasury was all but empty, and as for the
jewels, they belonged to the king. Besides, their
value has been much exaggerated. Most unfortunately.
If they had been worth more, my task would
be an easier one.&#8221;</p>

<p>The countess smiled. It was impossible to be annoyed
with the baron.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please finish the story,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>The audience was beginning to filter back into its
seats for the last act.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is but a word more. As I said just now, I
am going to place the king back on his throne.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the jewels are not all sold?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas&mdash;long since!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>The baron&#8217;s eyes were burning as he leaned forward
toward her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;do you know what I propose? The most
ironic coup in history! I propose to use for our
king the millions heaped up for that king of copper
by the very men who are now ruling in our stead.
Superb, is it not?&#8221;</p>

<p>She was staring at him, striving to understand.</p>

<p>But before she could speak, the lights went out,
there came a sharp rap from the conductor, and the
orchestra began.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV<br />


ALLIANCE</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THIS time it was the baron who attended and
the countess who was distraught. The story
he had told her had awakened memories and
emotions deeper, more violent, than he suspected,
and though she managed to keep her face serene, she
was on fire within. Whereas the baron, assured that
he was making progress, could abandon himself to a
new sensation, the pleasure of hearing &#8220;E lucevan le
stelle&#8221; incomparably sung by a voice as smooth, as
soft, as iridescent as the satin in old Flemish paintings.
For John McCormack was making his d&eacute;but
as Mario that evening, and it was not until this moment
that he found himself.</p>

<p>And the audience sat spellbound and listened.</p>

<p>There was no resisting the wild applause, which
refused to be silenced. Perhaps the singer, after the
shortcomings of the earlier acts, welcomed the opportunity
to show what he could do. At any rate,
he nodded to M. Lauweryns, who was waiting expectantly
with raised baton.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not possible for him to sing it again like
that!&#8221; cried an excited woman&#8217;s voice; but he did,
perhaps even a shade more perfectly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, let us go,&#8221; said the baron, when it was
over. &#8220;Let us keep that voice fresh in our ears. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
is a pity he is so uncouth,&#8221; he added, as he laid the
countess&#8217;s wrap about her shoulders. &#8220;It must annoy
him very much. Now let us look for that scapegrace
of mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>They descended together to the atrium, but the
prince was not among the people loitering there.
The public gaming rooms beyond were jammed with
the usual sordid crowd&mdash;shabby old men and women
to whom the tables were the breath of life, who
spent week after week, month after month, watching
the wheel and recording every play, in the hope
of discovering a system; cheap adventurers, striving
to pick up a few francs; half-starved shop-girls, risking
their last little notes with trembling hands;
harpies of the underworld, trying to attach themselves
to any man who seemed to be winning; all the
ugly, tattered, repulsive fringes of society....</p>

<p>&#8220;He would not be here,&#8221; said the baron, and
hastened through the tainted atmosphere to the private
rooms beyond.</p>

<p>But neither was the prince there, and after a vain
look around, the baron had a word with the chief
inspector.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. le Prince was here,&#8221; said the inspector, &#8220;but
only for a moment. He met some one he knew&mdash;a
young man, a newcomer, an American apparently,
not yet known to the attendants. They went away
together&mdash;perhaps to the Sporting Club.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you; we shall see,&#8221; said the baron.</p>

<p>As he turned away, the countess, who had listened
to all this with the utmost indifference, suppressed a
slight yawn.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will see me to my hotel,&#8221; she suggested.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>The baron came back with a start to the obligations
of the moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see how it is!&#8221; he protested. &#8220;I am no
longer myself. These affairs grow too much for me&mdash;it
is a sign that I am getting old. You will forgive
me, will you not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, yes&mdash;run along and search for your prince.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Confound the prince,&#8221; said the baron. &#8220;Let us
go to Ciro&#8217;s&mdash;I am sure you are thirsty. Besides,
I have still much to say to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The countess hesitated. It would not do to be too
docile to this Lappo&mdash;a little discipline might
strengthen her position.</p>

<p>&#8220;Prove that you forgive me,&#8221; he urged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; she agreed. After all, she wanted
to hear what he had still to tell her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alors,&#8221; he went on, half to himself, as they
moved together back through the rooms, &#8220;the worst
that he can do is to borrow some money from this
new friend. One debt more&mdash;that is nothing; there
are already so many!&#8221;</p>

<p>The countess looked at him with a little smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you do it?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Annoy yourself in this way. If your country
chooses to be a republic, why not go and amuse yourself
somewhere else? Paris is much livelier than
Goritza.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is in my blood,&#8221; said the baron, with a shrug
of helplessness. &#8220;My great-grandfather placed the
first Ghita on the throne and established the kingdom;
my grandfather enlarged it; my father consolidated
it. It was left for me to see it fall to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
pieces, in company with so many others. I cannot
go away and leave it; something inside me, something
stronger than myself, compels me to labour, to
expend myself, to set it up again. It is a duty I
cannot escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A curse, rather!&#8221; corrected the countess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps so. Yes, perhaps it is a curse. Yet I
have had my moments,&#8221; and he fell silent, smiling
at recollection of some of them.</p>

<p>The attendants saluted respectfully as they passed
through the doors and down the steps, out into the
night. To the right, Ciro&#8217;s great electric sign
flamed high against the sky, dimming the stars. The
countess glanced at it with a shiver of repulsion at
thought of the crowded restaurant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us not go to Ciro&#8217;s,&#8221; she said, impulsively.
&#8220;I prefer the terrace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; assented the baron. &#8220;We shall
be taken for lovers. If I were ten years
younger....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not be silly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will be warm enough?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; she said, and together they turned to
the left, around the end of the building, and down
the steps to the terrace which overlooks the sea.
They found a seat just back of the balustrade, and
sat for a moment without speaking, looking out into
the night, warm, jewelled, scented like a woman.</p>

<p>To the right glowed the green and red beacons
marking the harbour entrance, and above them a
string of lights mounted along the road to the summit
of the rock where the Prince of Monaco has his
palace and his great museum. In front of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
stretched the Mediterranean, faintly phosphorescent,
breaking into white here and there, and lapping
rhythmically against the rocky beach. To the left,
another row of lights marked the road along the
shore, stretching far out into the water along the
western edge of Cap Martin.</p>

<p>The beauty, the silence, the repose, fell like a balm
upon the baron&#8217;s troubled spirit. He exhaled slowly
from his lungs the fetid air of the casino, and took a
long breath of the perfumed night. Some of his years
fell from him&mdash;his memory, at least, turned back to
another night, long ago, when he had sat, with the
only woman he had ever loved beside him, on the
terrace at Montreaux, looking out across Lake Leman.
Love and the baron&mdash;one could smile, now,
to find those words together; but there had been a
time....</p>

<p>And perhaps Vera, Countess R&eacute;mond, also had
her momentary vision; but she was younger and so
less sentimental than the baron&mdash;she, also, had her
pressing problems!&mdash;and it was she who broke the
spell.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were saying you needed my help,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Is it to bewitch this American copper king into giving
you his money? In that case, I warn you that I
shall try first to get it for myself!&#8221;</p>

<p>The baron, who had come back to the present
with a start, looked about him to make sure they
could not be overheard; but the terrace was deserted
save for a few other couples snuggled together on
the benches and a blue-coated gardien pacing solemnly
up and down.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said; &#8220;it is not that at all. This king,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
like all kings, was mortal. You had not heard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has been dead nearly a year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said the countess, understanding suddenly;
&#8220;it is the widow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;a terrifying woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>The countess smiled at his tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it she who is ambitious?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Immeasurably!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you are going to marry her to the king!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the baron, rubbing his ear thoughtfully.
&#8220;I had considered that&mdash;the lady would not
be difficult; but the king rebelled. He pointed out
that he had married once for the good of his kingdom,
and that once was all that could be demanded
of any man. Besides, that would be a little too&mdash;a
little too&mdash;well, not exactly in the best taste. And
finally, the Ghitas have a law that never shall the
head of the house marry a widow. Of course, in an
affair of this importance, these fine-drawn questions
of taste might be disregarded, and the king could
always abrogate the law. But he is inexorable&mdash;not
even to regain his throne will he marry a middle-aged
American widow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt he fears to appear ridiculous,&#8221; suggested
the countess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the good Pietro never cared much about
appearances,&#8221; said the baron. &#8220;What he fears is to
lose his freedom. I do not blame him,&#8221; he added
impartially.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; asked the countess, &#8220;what is it you
propose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is the prince,&#8221; said the baron.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>&#8220;But surely you do not suppose that he will
marry a middle-aged American widow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; said the baron; &#8220;he will marry the
daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was gazing out across the water and so did
not see the sudden wave of colour which flooded the
woman&#8217;s face, and then receded, leaving it deadly
white. She sat very still, as though holding herself
with iron bands, and turned her head away, and
took a slow, deep, tremulous breath. Then she
touched her handkerchief to her lips, and when she
took it away, there was a tiny stain of blood upon it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will she consent?&#8221; she asked in a muffled voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not sure,&#8221; said the baron; &#8220;it is there I am
baffled. It is there I count upon you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her mother does all she can to persuade her,
but unfortunately it seems that in America girls are
permitted to choose for themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the countess, a little breathlessly;
&#8220;what does she say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She says very little; she sits and listens, looking
very far away. She is an unusual girl; she could be
charming if she wished. For some reason, she does
not wish. It is strange in one so young. Also she
has brains&mdash;perhaps her father&#8217;s; certainly not her
mother&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The alliance has been proposed to her then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; it is arranged. It waits only upon her consent.
And she hesitates. It is very strange. There
seem to be two forces at work in her, one urging her
on, one holding her back. It is not ambition that
urges her on, I am sure of that; and it is not love&mdash;the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
prince leaves her indifferent. But whatever it is,
I feel that it will win&mdash;unless something happens.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What can happen?&#8221; asked the countess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, madame,&#8221; sighed the baron, &#8220;it is a situation
of infinite delicatesse. The scales are so nicely balanced
that a breath will sway them. If I could only
comprehend the psychology of the American young
woman. Does she know more than she should, or
less than she should? What really goes on inside
her head? I confess I sometimes grow confused
talking to this one! Then there is the prince,&#8221;
added the baron, sighing again. &#8220;He is already
married.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard so,&#8221; nodded the countess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Morganatically&mdash;which is, of course, no marriage
at all, and much better than indiscriminate affairs.
It is, as I have explained to the mother, like
marrying a man who has been divorced. Americans
do not object to that. But what I fear&mdash;what must
not take place&mdash;is a scene, an encounter. That
would ruin everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is here, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is at the Hotel de Paris. She goes by the
name of Madame Ghita.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The prince sees her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But of course. He has been extraordinarily
faithful. That is what I meant when I said that his
affair had become too serious. But I can manage
that&mdash;he will not dare disobey his grandfather.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; asked the countess a little impatiently,
&#8220;what is it you want me to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two things,&#8221; said the baron. &#8220;You will permit
me to introduce you to Madame Davis and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
daughter. You are the sort of friend they need to
instruct them in savoir faire, to make of them, so
far as it is possible, women of the world. You will
show them the absurdity of the provincial point of
view.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; and the other?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To speak to this woman whom the prince married
in Paris; to gain her confidence, if you can; to
convince her that her interest lies in keeping quiet&mdash;that
otherwise the prince will be a pauper unable to
give her a son. I will empower you to make her a
definite offer&mdash;a most generous one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think you could do that more effectively
yourself,&#8221; said the countess.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have tried,&#8221; said the baron, sadly; &#8220;but to me
she will not listen. She speaks of such a thing as
love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Women do, sometimes!&#8221; commented the countess.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I am disarmed,&#8221; added the baron, &#8220;because
I admire her; because my heart speaks for her. She
is a remarkable woman&mdash;much too clever for the
prince. But you will see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have said no word of M. Selden,&#8221; the
countess pointed out. &#8220;Why did you send me such
elaborate instructions with regard to him&mdash;even
some of his articles to read?&#8221;</p>

<p>The baron laughed softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I may say so,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;I am something
of an artist. I like my pictures to be complete and
harmonious. We must consider how the world, and
especially England, will receive the announcement of
this marriage, for its object will be at once plain to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
every one. Selden is a man of great influence; his
articles are read everywhere. I have sometimes even
fancied that he is responsible for the reluctance
which Mlle. Davis shows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In what way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems that she has read his glowing account
of our new republic. We have discussed it together,
and I have pointed out his errors; but she is not convinced.
If he could be brought to our point of view,
and would tell her so, I am certain the affair would
be settled. Moreover, an article or two in the proper
vein would do much to influence public opinion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He does not seem easily impressed,&#8221; said the
countess, reflectively.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not expect you to impress him,&#8221; explained
the baron hastily. &#8220;It would be folly to think of
approaching him in that way. But I hope to prove
to him that the king, with millions in his hands, can
do much more for our country than Jeneski. And it
is true&mdash;what we propose is for the country&#8217;s good.
I am certain I can make him see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But my part?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will be to keep him amused. Impress him, if
you can&mdash;but be very careful. Above all, talk to
him and find out what he is thinking.&#8221;</p>

<p>The countess gazed unseeingly out across the
water; at last the baron&#8217;s intentions lay clear before
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear baron,&#8221; said the countess, &#8220;I have not
forgotten all I owe to you....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, when one begins in that tone!&#8221; interjected
the baron, with a gesture of disappointment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>&#8220;But wait. I am not refusing. I am only asking
myself whether I can really be of service. If I can,
you may rely upon me. As you know, I have my
own reasons.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little convulsion ran across her face. The baron
was looking at her keenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;First I must meet these Americans and this Madame
Ghita. After that we shall see!&#8221;</p>

<p>The baron took her hand and raised it to his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have given me an enchanted hour, my dear,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;but....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;One hour is all
you can allow yourself!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true,&#8221; he assented dismally.</p>

<p>The countess rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take me to my hotel,&#8221; she said; &#8220;then you can
go search for your scapegrace!&#8221;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V<br />


MADAME GHITA</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Sporting Club at Monte Carlo is a creation
of recent years, an effort on the part of
M. Blanc and his associates to meet the demand
for a place where one can gamble longer and
higher and more variously than is possible at the
casino. So here the wheels revolve and the cards
fall until four in the morning, instead of stopping at
midnight, and to roulette and trente-et-quarante is
added baccara, with the sky as the only limit.</p>

<p>It is supposed to be more select, this club, and the
proviso is made of requiring an introduction; but
introducers can be picked up any morning on the
terrace, or the management of any of the hotels will
supply them if requested; so that any one of fairly
presentable appearance and willing to pay a hundred
and fifty francs for the privilege, may gamble there
as long as his money lasts.</p>

<p>The club is housed in a beautiful building of white
stone just around the corner from the Hotel de
Paris, so Selden had only a few steps to go. His
card and the payment of the fee admitted him, for
he had been &#8220;introduced&#8221; the year before, and in a
moment the electric lift had carried him noiselessly
to the gaming-room de luxe which occupies the
length of the upper story.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>It was filled with a crowd of which at least two-thirds
were women&mdash;the same sort of women he had
seen earlier in the hotel lounge&mdash;and the air was
stale and heavy with perfume and tobacco. It was
a strangely silent crowd, sitting or standing with
eyes intent upon the tables, the only sounds being
those incident to the game: the voices of the croupiers
inviting their patrons to place their bets, the
quick whir of the ivory ball about the rim of the roulette
wheel, the warning that no more bets could be
placed, the rattle of the ball falling into a compartment,
the announcement of the winning number, and
the clatter of the little rakes pulling in the bank&#8217;s
winnings. It is less picturesque and exciting than in
the days before the war, for then the wagers were
made in gold, and there was the clink of coins and
the gleam of yellow metal which men have always
found so fascinating; but now gold circulates no
more in Europe, and wagers are made with disks of
coloured celluloid, purchased from the croupiers with
the paper notes which have been pouring so freely
from the printing-presses. And if one wins, it is
with this same flimsy paper that one is paid. A
fool&#8217;s game, truly!</p>

<p>Selden threaded his way among the groups, looking
for the countess and her companions, but he succeeded
in discovering only the prince. He was
seated at the end of a table next to the croupier, and
at the moment Selden caught sight of him he was
drawing toward himself a pile of notes which the
croupier in charge of the bank had just counted out
and pushed toward him. He seemed to be well
known&mdash;or perhaps one of the attach&eacute;s had noised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
his identity about as an advertisement&mdash;and a curious
crowd was watching his proceedings.</p>

<p>Selden assured himself that neither the countess
nor Lappo was in the rooms, then he returned to
watch, too, for he was curious to learn something of
the prince&#8217;s personality. One glance at his face was
enough to show that gambling was indeed, as the
countess had said, in his blood. He was the true
type. Utterly oblivious of the crowd about him, his
dark skin aglow with inward fire, but entirely calm
and collected&mdash;cold as ice, indeed!&mdash;he was playing
without hesitation or timidity, relying apparently
upon some inward guidance which he trusted implicitly
and upon which he was ready to wager his
last franc. With a run of luck, a gambler of this
type sometimes wins enormously; but, on the other
hand, when luck is bad it requires not many turns
of the wheel to take away all he has. And the wheel
turns very rapidly!</p>

<p>At this moment, the prince was having a run of
luck, and the crowd was watching to see how far it
would take him, while a few were trying to follow
his plays and get the advantage of his luck while
it lasted. He was playing the number twenty-seven,
with maximums not only en plein, but also on the
cheveaux, the carr&eacute;s and the transversales&mdash;a total
of about six thousand francs&mdash;and twenty-seven had
issued three times in the last fifteen plays. In other
words, in fifteen plays the prince had lost seventy
thousand francs and won two hundred thousand.
And as Selden watched, twenty-seven came again and
another sixty thousand was added to the prince&#8217;s
winnings.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>A murmur of excitement ran through the watching
group, for the chef de partie had rung a little bell
and had sent the attendant who answered it to the
cashier for more money&mdash;which is as near to breaking
the bank as any one can come.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is now that he should quit,&#8221; said a woman at
Selden&#8217;s side. &#8220;If he keeps on he will only lose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps the voice reached the prince&#8217;s ears, or
perhaps some such thought was in his mind, for he
hesitated, as his stake was swept away after the next
play, and passed his hand before his eyes, as though
awaking from a dream. He tried again, however,
and lost; a second time, and lost; a third time,
and lost; then he tossed a thousand-franc note to
the croupier, folded up his winnings and thrust them
into his pocket, and made his way through a respectful
crowd to the buffet.</p>

<p>It was not until then that Selden perceived the
prince had a companion. A blonde young man who
had been sitting next to him rose as he did, with an
approving nod, and disappeared into the buffet with
him. Selden scarcely had time to look at him, but
he got the impression that he was very young, and
also that he was an American. The prince had
found a new victim, perhaps....</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, M. Selden,&#8221; said a voice at his elbow, and
he turned to find the Baron Lappo smiling up at him;
&#8220;the work is finished, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I got it off,&#8221; answered Selden, and glanced
behind the baron and on either side of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;The countess decided she would not come to-night,&#8221;
said the baron, interpreting the look. &#8220;I
also would have sought my bed&mdash;the old need the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
sleep of beauty even more than the young!&mdash;but,
alas, I have responsibilities. Have you, by any
chance, seen our little prince?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Selden, smiling at the adjective; &#8220;I
think you will find him in the buffet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So long as he is not playing!&#8221; and the baron
breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has been playing&mdash;breaking the bank, in
fact.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, he has won?&#8221; exclaimed the baron.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hugely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I am indeed alarmed! I must seek him.
You will join us, I hope?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With pleasure,&#8221; said Selden, and followed the
baron across the room.</p>

<p>The old diplomat was evidently well known and
highly esteemed, for he had many respectful salutations
to acknowledge, but the buffet was reached
at last. The prince and the blonde young man,
seated on a banquette in one corner, were watching
a waiter fill their glasses with champagne.</p>

<p>The baron&#8217;s face darkened as he saw the prince&#8217;s
companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Imbecile!&#8221; he muttered under his breath, and advanced
straight upon them.</p>

<p>The prince, raising his glass to his lips, raised his
eyes also, and saw the baron.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along, my old one!&#8221; he cried, no whit discomposed
by the baron&#8217;s stormy face. &#8220;You also,
M. Selden. Two more glasses,&#8221; he added to the
waiter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for me at this hour!&#8221; protested the baron.
&#8220;A demi Vittel,&#8221; and as the waiter hurried away,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
he turned to the blonde youth. &#8220;I am happy to meet
you again, M. Davis,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I hope that your
mother and your sister are well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, thank you,&#8221; Davis responded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Permit me to introduce a compatriot of yours,
M. Selden,&#8221; went on the baron.</p>

<p>&#8220;Happy to meet you,&#8221; said Davis, with a negligent
nod.</p>

<p>Selden reflected that Davis did not seem particularly
glad to see the baron. He was a good-looking
youth, too young for his face to have taken on much
character, evidently self-willed, and probably spoiled
by that mother and sister for whom the baron had
inquired.</p>

<p>The baron was regarding the prince with a mildly
ironic glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hear you have been winning,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;I had an inspiration for twenty-seven,&#8221;
the prince replied. &#8220;It is a long time,&#8221; he added to
Selden, &#8220;since I have had any luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it is the turn of the tide,&#8221; Selden suggested.
&#8220;I hope so!&#8221; and he raised the glass the
waiter had filled for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you; it was time!&#8221; said the prince, and
the three young men drank, while the baron sipped
his water moodily. &#8220;You do not seem pleased, M.
le Baron,&#8221; added the prince, looking at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;For you to win!&#8221; said the baron with a grimace.
&#8220;It is so unusual&mdash;like the sun rising in the west. I
am wondering what great misfortune is about to
happen!&#8221; and he added a sentence in a language
which Selden did not understand&mdash;his native tongue,
no doubt.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>The prince flushed rebelliously, and the baron
spoke another sentence, in a tone more peremptory.
The prince nodded sulkily and rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will excuse us for a moment,&#8221; said the
baron, rising too, and he slipped his arm through
that of the prince and led him away.</p>

<p>Davis stared after them speculatively until they
disappeared through the door into the outer room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Queer duck, the baron,&#8221; he remarked, and refilled
his glass. &#8220;I wonder what game he is up to
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I met him just this evening,&#8221; said Selden; &#8220;but
I rather like him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s all right,&#8221; agreed Davis; &#8220;deucedly
clever and all that&mdash;makes me feel like I belong in
the infant class; but he is too blamed serious and he
seems to think the whole world centres in that little
speck he calls his country. I give you my word, I
hunted it on the map for half an hour the other day
before I found it, and then I could scarcely see it.
Do you know anything about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve been there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The deuce you have! Now tell me,&#8221; and he
leaned closer; &#8220;did this old king really amount to
anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean did his position amount to anything.
Was he really a king, or was he just a joke?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course he was a king, the social equal of any
other king. He married his children into the most
exclusive courts of Europe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know that. And if he got back again, it
would be the same thing?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>&#8220;If he got back, he might have even more prestige,&#8221;
said Selden, &#8220;since there are fewer kings in
business these days, and to get back would be a
great feat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Davis, and settled back again in
his corner.</p>

<p>Selden wondered what interest this youth could
possibly have in the king&#8217;s restoration&mdash;just his
friendship with the prince, no doubt. It was evident
that he had been drinking too much&mdash;just enough too
much to flush his face and loosen his tongue. He
could not be over twenty, and in spite of his good
looks, there was something in his mouth and chin
which spoke of weakness and self-indulgence. And
it was also plain that his inhibitions to indiscreet utterance
were not as strong as they should have been.</p>

<p>Selden was well aware that nothing is more revealing
of a man&#8217;s character than a glass of champagne
too much. It loosens the tongue of the weak
man&mdash;the ordinary man; breaks down his reserve
and prods him on to talk carelessly and boastfully,
to prove his importance at whatever cost. But with
the strong man the effect is quite the contrary; he
grows more guarded with every glass&mdash;the result,
perhaps, of breeding, of wisdom gained by experience.
At any rate, <i>in vino veritas</i> does not work
with him.</p>

<p>But young Davis was not at all of this class. It
was plain that he had neither breeding nor experience;
and Selden told himself that a boy like that
should be at work, or at least in college, not lounging
in the Monte Carlo Sporting Club with no one to
look after him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>&#8220;The thing I particularly object to in the baron,&#8221;
went on Davis, reverting to his original grievance
after the manner of slightly tipsy men, &#8220;is that he
seems to think I need a guardian.&#8221;</p>

<p>On this point Selden thoroughly agreed with the
baron, but he didn&#8217;t say so.</p>

<p>&#8220;In what way?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s all the time trying to keep the prince
away from me&mdash;seems to be afraid to leave us alone
together! Good gad, if he only knew!&#8221; and he
chuckled to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you staying here?&#8221; Selden asked, to change
the subject. He had some scruples about encouraging
champagne confidences.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; we&#8217;ve got a villa over at Cimiez&mdash;just
above Nice, you know. But I&#8217;m over here a good
part of the time. Dingy place, Nice, don&#8217;t you
think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ve seen you before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I got in just this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From Paris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; from Austria.&#8221;</p>

<p>Davis looked at him with sudden interest, as
though struck by a new idea.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you say your name is?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Selden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Selden, that&#8217;s it. You&#8217;re not the chap who has
been writing those articles in the <i>Times</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Selden admitted; &#8220;but you don&#8217;t mean to
say you&#8217;ve read them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; Davis hastened to assure him; &#8220;too
heavy for me. But my sister has&mdash;she&#8217;s nutty about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
them. I say, can&#8217;t you come over and have lunch
with us to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; said Selden drily, &#8220;but I have an engagement.&#8221;
He had no desire to discuss central
Europe with immature Americans.</p>

<p>&#8220;But look here,&#8221; Davis protested; and then he
sprang to his feet so violently that he nearly upset
the table. &#8220;There you are at last!&#8221; he cried, his
face beaming.</p>

<p>Selden turned to find that two women had approached
and were standing just behind him&mdash;two
most unusual women, both young; but one, the
younger and prettier, evidently jeune fille; the other,
the elder and more striking, just as evidently a
poised and finished woman of the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. le Prince, ees &#8217;e not &#8217;ere?&#8221; inquired the latter
in delightful English, and she permitted her eyes
to rest calmly and inquiringly upon Selden, who had
also risen, as though asking what right he had to
be there and what manner of man he was.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are waiting for him,&#8221; Davis explained.
&#8220;The baron took him away a minute ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, le baron!&#8221; and she made a moue of distaste;
&#8220;&#8217;im I &#8217;ave no wish to see,&#8221; and she started
to move away.</p>

<p>&#8220;But look here,&#8221; protested Davis, &#8220;the prince is
expecting you&mdash;I want to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Farceur, eet is Cicette you wish to see!&#8221; she
laughed, and glanced at the pretty girl beside her.
And indeed it was at Cicette that Davis had been
gazing&mdash;insufferable young fool, Selden told himself,
to look at Cicette, mere milk-and-water beside
this other woman, so distinguished, so unusual, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
surely poised&mdash;not beautiful exactly, but with such
charm, such magnetism....</p>

<p>Again her eyes were resting upon his.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you speak French, monsieur?&#8221; she inquired
in that language.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, madame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then say to this young man&mdash;for my English
gives me shame&mdash;that we are going back for half
an hour of chemin-de-fer. If he and M. le Prince
care to join us before that, good; if not, we will
look in here again on our way out. Thank you,&#8221;
she added, when Selden had passed this on. &#8220;Come,
Cicette.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she turned away, her eyes met his again in
that same questioning, impersonal regard. Yet it
was not altogether impersonal, for somehow, at
bottom, it was deeply intimate&mdash;if one could only
tear away a veil! Looking after her, he noted the
exquisite poise of her head, how superbly she moved&mdash;like
a queen; no, he had never seen a queen who
walked like that! Why the devil hadn&#8217;t Davis introduced
him?</p>

<p>Cicette glanced back over her shoulder and gave
Davis an encouraging nod and smile as she passed
from sight.</p>

<p>That young man, who had been watching, fascinated,
dropped into his seat again and poured himself
out some more wine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t she a corker?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is certainly a pretty girl,&#8221; agreed Selden, and
was tempted to add a word of caution, but checked
himself. After all, it was no affair of his. &#8220;Who
is she?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>&#8220;Her name is Cicette Fayard. She is a niece of
Madame Ghita. Believe me, madame takes good
care of her&mdash;never lets her out of her sight&mdash;makes
me feel like a beast of prey! I&#8217;ve been trying to
pick up some French, so I can talk to her, but I
haven&#8217;t made much out of it yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame Ghita?&#8221; repeated Selden. &#8220;That is
the name of the elder one?&#8221;</p>

<p>Davis nodded.</p>

<p>Ghita. Selden repeated the word to himself, for
it had awakened some faint echo of recognition in
his brain. Ghita. Where had he heard that before?
For the life of him he couldn&#8217;t remember.</p>

<p>&#8220;She looks like a clever woman,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is clever,&#8221; agreed Davis; &#8220;the cleverest
woman I&#8217;ve ever known.&#8221; He spoke as though he
had known hundreds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she a Pole?&#8221; asked Selden. &#8220;Poles are sometimes
very clever&mdash;and the name sounds Polish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s her husband&#8217;s name,&#8221; said Davis. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know for sure, but I fancy she&#8217;s French.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again some memory stirred in Selden&#8217;s brain,
more strongly. Her husband&#8217;s name. Ghita. And
then it came like a flash.</p>

<p>Ghita&mdash;that was the family name of the old
dynasty&mdash;the family name of the prince....</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI<br />


ON THE SHORTCOMINGS OF REPUBLICS</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SELDEN did not attempt to explain to himself
his sudden interest in this fascinating unknown,
but he was determined to find out
about her all that he could. His first impulse had
been to chide Davis for not introducing him, but
he suppressed it. If the lady was married&mdash;and
especially if she was married to a Ghita&mdash;Davis
might not have felt himself a free agent, though
Selden doubted if he was even aware of the continental
point of view in that regard. More probably
it was merely lack of savoir faire. Even without
an introduction, the lady had not hesitated to address
him. She was not, then, too much bound by
convention. But this was not a drawing-room&mdash;it
was the Sporting Club at Monte Carlo. And she
was not drinking tea; she was playing chemin-de-fer.
These were points that were worth thinking
over.</p>

<p>Selden offered Davis a cigarette, before lighting
one himself, but Davis did not see it. His eyes were
still fixed on the door through which the women had
disappeared. Evidently the net was already around
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;So she is married, is she?&#8221; Selden remarked
casually. &#8220;Is her husband with her here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; and Davis came to himself with a start.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
&#8220;Yes&mdash;that is, she&#8217;s not exactly married, either&mdash;not
as we understand it. You see, it&#8217;s like
this....&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry to have been so long,&#8221; said the
baron&#8217;s voice, and Selden looked up to find him and
the prince smiling down at them. At least the
baron was smiling, most urbanely; but it was difficult
to tell whether it was good-humour or suppressed
chagrin that parted the prince&#8217;s lips. &#8220;You have
amused each other, I hope?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said Selden; &#8220;we have been having a
most interesting time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; and the baron sank down again into his
chair, and polished his glass thoughtfully. &#8220;It is
disgusting, but even here affairs of state sometimes
intrude.&#8221;</p>

<p>The prince had resumed his seat against the wall
and looked moodily at the champagne bottle. It
was empty.</p>

<p>Selden caught the eye of the attentive waiter, who
nodded and hurried away. He felt that he was
upon the threshold of a most interesting disclosure,
which a little more wine might precipitate. To be
married, and at the same time not to be married!
He was conscious that his objection to champagne
confidences had considerably diminished. Besides,
he wanted an excuse to stay awhile longer.</p>

<p>But a sudden silence had fallen upon Davis. He
evidently felt himself back again in the infant class,
and he glanced at the baron from time to time with
a certain uneasiness, as a bad boy might glance at
his master. The prince was also silent, staring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
fixedly at the table in front of him, his lips pursed,
his brows contracted in a frown. As for the baron,
he was puffing thoughtfully at a cigarette, his eyes
on the ceiling, immersed perhaps in those affairs of
state of which he had spoken.</p>

<p>So they remained until the waiter brought the
new bottle and filled fresh glasses.</p>

<p>The stimulant seemed to nerve the prince to do
something he did not in the least want to do. He
produced a bulky envelope from his pocket and
handed it to Davis.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very happy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;to be able to repay
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Davis took the envelope, evidently astonished,
and glanced at the figures written upon it.</p>

<p>&#8220;But look here,&#8221; he protested, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want this&mdash;I
don&#8217;t need it&mdash;I&#8217;d rather you kept it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible!&#8221; said the prince. &#8220;It is a debt of
honour. I might not again be in position to repay
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, all right, if you look at it that way,&#8221; said
Davis sulkily, and started to cram the envelope into
his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;You find the amount correct, I trust?&#8221; put in
the baron smoothly.</p>

<p>Davis glanced at the envelope again.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a matter of fact, I think it&#8217;s too much,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you have kept a memorandum?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;since the prince insisted!&#8221; and he drew a
little memorandum book from his pocket.</p>

<p>Selden could scarcely repress a smile. There is
nothing more characteristic of the confirmed borrower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
than insistence on keeping meticulous accounts.
To enter the amount in a book is almost
like placing it in a bank. It proves how conscientious
one is.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please check it over,&#8221; suggested the baron.</p>

<p>Davis did so.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just as I thought,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You&#8217;ve given
me ten thousand francs too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>The prince got out his own memorandum book,
monogrammed in gold on the back, turned over the
pages till he found the right one, and compared the
accounts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, see,&#8221; he said; &#8220;you forgot to make this
entry on the sixteenth&mdash;ten thousand francs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please make it now,&#8221; said the baron, &#8220;and mark
the amount paid, after verifying the sum in the
envelope.&#8221;</p>

<p>Davis, his face redder than ever, made the entry,
then broke open the envelope and drew out a packet
of thousand-franc notes&mdash;at least fifty or sixty of
them&mdash;ran through them with shaking fingers,
nodded, stuffed them into his pocket and wrote Paid
in large letters across the memorandum.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be as well to add the date,&#8221; said the
baron.</p>

<p>Davis complied impatiently, and returned the
book to his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you are satisfied,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The baron nodded good-naturedly and lighted
another cigarette.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;you are very good to humour me. Perhaps
I may seem bourgeois,&#8221; he went on to Selden,
&#8220;but it annoys me to have debts of that sort hanging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
over us, for they are the most embarrassing of
all. I know that many people call us adventurers,
robbers, and other hard names. They say we never
pay our debts. It is a lie. I admit,&#8221; he added, with
a smile, &#8220;that sometimes our money does not hold
out and our creditors have to wait, but they expect
that, and place it in the bill. In the end they are
always paid.&#8221; He paused and glanced at his watch.
&#8220;One o&#8217;clock! I must be getting back to Nice.
You will come with me, my prince?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the prince; &#8220;I will return later with
M. Davis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I want to try my luck first,&#8221; said Davis, and
rose to his feet, evidently glad of an excuse to get
away. &#8220;I also have an inspiration.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope it may be a good one,&#8221; said Danilo, and
rose too. &#8220;I will come with you and see. Good night,
M. Selden. I hope to meet you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be sure to hear from my sister!&#8221; said
Davis, and the two hurried away like boys released
from school.</p>

<p>The baron watched them with a look between a
smile and a frown; then he settled back into his
chair, apparently in no hurry to start for home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it that you know the sister of M. Davis?&#8221; he
asked casually.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not at all; but he says his sister has been
reading those articles of mine which annoyed you
so much, and was interested in them&mdash;though I
can&#8217;t imagine why.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; said the baron thoughtfully. &#8220;Well,
it is true. As it happens, I know the sister of M.
Davis, and have even discussed those articles with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
her. She is a most intelligent young lady, and she
was deeply impressed by your point of view.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why on earth should she be interested?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that!&#8221; said the baron, with a shrug.
&#8220;Americans are interested in so many things. Believe
me, M. Selden, I am quite sincere in saying
that I found your articles admirable. It is true they
annoyed me&mdash;the more so because I found them so
good. But you took M. Jeneski&#8217;s theories too much
for granted. He is an able man&mdash;yes; but he is also
an idealist. He does not see the practical difficulties
in the way of carrying out his programme.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps they are not so serious as you think,&#8221;
suggested Selden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh, bien, let us look at them for a moment. In
the first place, you, as an American, are prepossessed
in favour of a republic. Is it not so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The word means so much to you that sometimes
you mistake the word for the thing it signifies. In
my country they have as yet only the word. Jeneski,
supported by the army, sets up a government and
calls it a republic&mdash;that is all. It is not in any sense
a republic; it is a military despotism.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are going to have elections next month,&#8221;
Selden pointed out.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how many people will vote at those elections?
Very few outside the capital. Even they
will be intimidated by the army, and will be afraid
to vote, except for the government. For do not forget
that not only does the army vote, but it will be
in control of the polling-places. If all the people
had the opportunity to vote without being terrorized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
or intimidated, and were given a free choice between
Jeneski and the king, do you know whom they would
choose? They would choose the king.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very possibly,&#8221; Selden admitted. &#8220;They have
all heard of the king, and very few have heard of
Jeneski. Fewer still have any idea as yet of what
a republic means.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, and they will never have,&#8221; said the baron,
&#8220;because it is not possible to give them a real republic.
They must first be educated&mdash;they must be
taught how to govern themselves. And it will be
impossible to teach them because they will need all
their efforts to keep themselves from starving.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they must take the chance,&#8221; said Selden,
&#8220;even if it requires generations. As I see it, the one
outstanding result of the war is the triumph of democracy.
If the people of Europe lose that, they
have lost everything. As long as they hold on to
it, no matter at what sacrifice, the war is worth all
it cost them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But democracy does not necessarily mean a
republic&mdash;that is a thing which Americans find
very difficult to understand. There is England,
for example&mdash;there is Holland, Belgium, Norway,
Sweden. They are not republics, but they are none
the less democracies&mdash;more truly so in some respects,
perhaps, even than your own. I, too, recognize
the triumph of democracy, and I rejoice in it;
but that does not mean that we must place the government
of the country in the hands of a mob.
Quite the contrary. There is no despotism worse
than mob despotism&mdash;nothing further removed from
the spirit of democracy. When I speak of restoration,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
he went on, &#8220;when I work for it, as I am
working now, I do not mean the restoration of old
autocracies, of outworn rights and privileges. I
mean the restoration of order and enlightened government.
A government must above all things have
intelligence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jeneski has intelligence,&#8221; Selden pointed out.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he has no resources. A government must
also have resources.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Selden began, and hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what is in your mind,&#8221; said Lappo
quickly. &#8220;You are thinking that neither has the
king any resources. That is true for the moment,
and as long as it is true, he will not seek to go back.
But if resources accrue to him, as they perhaps may,
I say to you that Jeneski will be committing a crime
against his country if he continues to oppose him.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused and glanced mechanically at his watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he said, starting to his feet, &#8220;I must be
going. Pardon me for talking so much at such an
hour! But it is a thing very near to my heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been deeply interested,&#8221; Selden hastened
to assure him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am most anxious for you to meet the king. He
is not at all what people suppose him. He is&mdash;but
you shall see for yourself. Ah, they never quit
gambling in this place!&#8221; he added, as they passed
through the door into the outer room.</p>

<p>The wheels were still turning without interruption.
The crowd was greater than ever, but neither
Davis nor Danilo was in sight. Selden suspected
that they were in the inner sanctum dedicated to
baccara, and he rather expected the baron to look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
them up. But that worthy seemed to have dismissed
them from his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall hear from me soon,&#8221; he said, and held
out his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going too,&#8221; said Selden, resolutely beating
back the desire to stay, to get another glimpse of
that clever, unusual face; and together he and the
baron went down the stair and got their coats.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am arranging a small dinner for to-morrow
evening,&#8221; said the baron suddenly, as they stood on
the steps outside, waiting for his car. &#8220;If you are
free, I should be very pleased to have you join us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. I shall be glad to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. I will let you know the time and place.
Till to-morrow, then!&#8221; and the baron stepped into
his car with a wave of the hand.</p>

<p>Selden stood for a moment looking after it, as it
sped down the slope toward the Condamine. Then
he turned the other way toward his hotel.</p>

<p>A strange man, the baron. More royalist than
the king, more concerned for the prince than the
prince was for himself, a courtier to the bone, a
man who knew the secrets of every court, the skeletons
in every closet.</p>

<p>And most probably not without skeletons in his
own!</p>

<p>Well, there were few closets without a skeleton
of some sort.</p>

<p>What, Selden wondered, was the skeleton in the
closet of the Countess R&eacute;mond? That grim tragedy
in the wood behind Bouresches?</p>

<p>And what game was the baron playing? Working
for a restoration&mdash;yes; but why had he compelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
the prince to return those many thousands of
francs to Davis in so summary a fashion? Most
extraordinary that&mdash;as though he were trying to
impress some one with his probity.</p>

<p>Davis, perhaps; but why should he care to impress
Davis? Who, after all, was Davis?</p>

<p>And who was Madame Ghita?</p>

<p>Pondering these and other questions, Selden
mounted to his room and went to bed. He could
find an answer to none of them, but he had a sense
of pleasurable excitement, for he felt that, in some
strange way, he had been drawn into an extraordinary
drama.</p>

<p>And its most interesting personage was undoubtedly
Madame Ghita.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII<br />


THE ROAD TO EZE</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MONTE CARLO, like all other pleasure resorts,
has its inexorable routine, and the
feature of the morning is a walk upon the
terrace. This is followed by an ap&eacute;ritif and half
an hour of gossip under a sun-shade in front of the
Caf&eacute; de Paris, these two items occupying the time
pleasantly until lunch, when the day really commences.</p>

<p>The terrace pedestrians begin to gather about
eleven o&#8217;clock, reach their densest an hour later, and
then gradually thin away. To sit during that hour
on one of the benches which face the walk is a rare
privilege.</p>

<p>For the human stream is of never-ceasing interest.
There is the nouveau-riche and his family, not
yet accustomed to the wealth the war showered
upon them, ill at ease in their new clothes, glancing
apprehensively at every one as though expecting an
accusation; there is the prognathous Englishman
masking his mental vacuity with an air of aloofness,
but alert to salute every one he considers his
social equal; there are old rou&eacute;s of every nationality,
hair plastered down (if there is any left), moustaches
waxed to a point, great pouches under the
eyes, ogling the women, especially the very young
ones, and turning around for another look at their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
legs and the motion of their hips; there is the stream
of semi-paralytics, neurasthenics, and debile generally,
flowing ceaselessly in and out of the hydropathic
establishment at the end of the terrace, seeking
relief from the results of unimaginable forms
of debauchery; there are fat Turks and lithe Greeks
who glare at each other; tall Russians and little
Italians who fraternize; as well as a scattering of all
the nationalities, scarcely yet knowing their own
names, created since the war over the breadth of
central Europe.</p>

<p>And then there are the women&mdash;the women who
are the raison d&#8217;&ecirc;tre for Monte Carlo and all resorts
like it. It is to see the women, to permit them
to exhibit themselves, that this morning parade
takes place; it is to please the women the chefs in
the great hotels labour; it is for them the orchestras
play; it is to them the little expensive shops cater;
it is for them the casino operates. And they are
at their best, these women, on the terrace in the
morning. The old ones are still in bed, the ugly
ones shun the merciless morning light. Only the
young and beautiful venture to sally forth, and
some of them are superb.</p>

<p>There are celebrities, too, of a sort, and decorations
of every degree, from the grand rosette of the
Legion down to the humble &#8220;poireau&#8221;; there are
grey-bearded Academicians, monocled diplomats,
pallid artists, heavy-sterned generals, portly financiers.
There is the Gargantuan McCormack, his hat
pulled down over his eyes, his lithe little wife trotting
beside him; there is the sallow Venizelos, not
yet recovered from the shock of defeat, in close<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
confab with some other exile; there is the talented
but enslaved Chalmino with his ridiculous fat mistress;
there is Marlborough and his next duchess;
there is Suzanne, fresh from her victories at La
Festa and twittering like a sparrow to two tall worshippers
in flannels; there is Chevrillet, the great
journalist, whose passion for play destroys him&mdash;these
and a hundred others like them pass and repass,
watch for a time the stupid slaughter of pigeons
going ceaselessly forward on the semi-circle of lawn
down near the water, and finally fade away.</p>

<p>Among this throng, Selden presently appeared in
obedience to a command of the Countess R&eacute;mond,
delivered to him that morning with his breakfast:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am in the mood for walking,&#8221; she had written.
&#8220;Please wait for me on the terrace.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, since he had made up his mind to see the
adventure through, here he was, walking up and
down, looking at the crowd, and breathing deep
draughts of the wonderful air. It was one of those
exquisite mornings, bright and yet soft, which make
the Riviera the most favoured of winter resorts.
The air was full of ozone, there was a tang in it
which gave a fillip to the blood; the sea was of a
deep and lustrous blue defying description, flecked
here and there with whitecaps and dotted with the
sails of a flotilla of little sloops engaged in a race.
On the landward side, steep slopes, clad with vine
and olive and dotted with white villas, rose up and
up, until they culminated with a mighty rush in the
rocky summit of the T&ecirc;te de Chien, two thousand
feet above.</p>

<p>A fairy-land; a land of wonder and delight.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>Selden turned from this loveliness and looked
again with a feeling of disgust at the people loitering
past. Was it for this crowd of parasites and
voluptuaries that this superb corner of the world
had been created? He had asked himself the same
question once before as he sat in the dining-saloon
of a great new ship, homeward bound from Europe&mdash;was
it merely to minister to the pleasures of that
crowd, and other crowds like it, that men had laboured
and sweated and died in the fabrication of
that marvellous boat? What mockery, what waste!
No wonder socialists see red! And then he had remembered
the hundreds in the steerage&mdash;to them
the ship was an ark, a sanctuary. It was bearing
them to the land of freedom.</p>

<p>But here there was no such saving purpose; it was
all mean, all sordid, compact of vanity and greed
and sensuality....</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, his eyes saw the face they had
been searching for, almost without his knowledge&mdash;the
arresting and clever face of Madame Ghita.
She, at least, had no reason to fear the light, nor
had the glowing young Cicette who chattered beside
her. Madame Ghita was listening and smiling as
though to a child, oblivious of the glances she attracted,
with that air of supreme poise which Selden
had noted and admired the night before. Would
she see him, he wondered, his heart accelerating its
beat....</p>

<p>Yes, she saw him; her eyes rested in his for an
instant, and she gave him a gracious little nod of
the head as she passed.</p>

<p>He was unreasonably elated&mdash;yet why shouldn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
she nod? Monte Carlo was not a formal place;
besides, he had been of some little assistance to her
the night before in interpreting her to Davis. It
was almost an invitation&mdash;should he turn and intercept
her? And then he caught himself up grimly;
really, he told himself, he was behaving like a boy
of twenty, rather than like an experienced and somewhat
disillusioned man of thirty-four. What could
Madame Ghita ever be to him? Nothing, of
course! Just the same, he would like to know her&mdash;no
harm in that!&mdash;she looked stimulating. Perhaps
she would pass again.</p>

<p>He turned at the end of the terrace&mdash;to find himself
face to face with the Countess R&eacute;mond.</p>

<p>&#8220;How you walk!&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;Like the wind.
And how people have stared to see me pursuing
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They must think me very fortunate!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well&mdash;yes!&#8221; she smiled. &#8220;But had you
quite forgotten me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgotten you! My dear countess!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you must have been composing a new
article, to stalk along like that with your head down,
looking neither to the right nor left.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Selden, as he fell into step beside her,
&#8220;I was reflecting how ironical it is that the most
beautiful spot on earth should be&mdash;what you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is always like that,&#8221; she pointed out.
&#8220;Not only the pleasantest places, but the nicest
things, belong to the people who least deserve
them. You should write an article about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden laughed grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a savage thrust!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you suppose I know how futile it is&mdash;writing
articles?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it futile?&#8221; she asked innocently.</p>

<p>&#8220;The most futile thing on earth! I ought to
know; I&#8217;ve been doing it all my life, and it makes
me sick to think of it. But don&#8217;t talk about it&mdash;don&#8217;t
spoil this beautiful morning. How can we
enjoy it best?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose you suggest something,&#8221; she said, looking
at him from under lowered lashes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You said you were in the mood for walking&mdash;did
you mean just walking here on the terrace?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in the least. I meant walking over the
eternal hills. See&mdash;I am dressed for it,&#8221; and she
held out for his inspection a slender foot shod sensibly&mdash;at
least, not too foolishly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I may have&mdash;how much time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Until five o&#8217;clock,&#8221; smiled the countess.</p>

<p>Selden was conscious that Madame Ghita and her
companion had turned at the other end of the terrace
and were coming back, but he kept his attention
riveted on his companion&mdash;even, to his own
ironic amusement, simulated an ardour he did not
feel, and which caused her to rest curious eyes upon
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Splendid!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Then here is the programme:
we will go up to La Turbie, have lunch,
walk along the Grande Corniche to Eze&mdash;do you
know Eze?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; is it a town?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;a gem. And we will sit there and look
at it and at the world stretched out beneath us, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
when we are quite ready, a car will bring us back.
Will that suit you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be lovely!&#8221; and she permitted her eyes
to caress him the merest bit. &#8220;But I would point
out that it is I who am taking your time, not you
mine. If you have something else to do....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; Selden broke in. &#8220;I may be an
American, but I don&#8217;t work all the time! Come
along!&#8221;</p>

<p>As they turned toward the steps, a bulky male
figure suddenly loomed in front of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how do you do,&#8221; said the countess, and then
Selden saw that the man with whom she was shaking
hands was John Halsey, who had been Paris
correspondent of the <i>London Journal</i> from time immemorial.
&#8220;Do you know Mr. Selden, Mr. Halsey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Selden?&#8221; echoed Halsey, who up to that moment
had not looked at him. &#8220;Oh, hello, Selden. I
thought you were somewhere in the Balkans.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not offer to shake hands and there was
something faintly hostile in his air.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m here,&#8221; said Selden briefly, wondering
if it could be possible that Halsey was jealous, or
if it was just his British manner.</p>

<p>But Halsey had already turned back to the
countess.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been looking for you everywhere,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I got in just a few minutes ago and they
told me at the hotel that you had gone out. I want
you to come to lunch with me. We must have a
talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something in his air at the same time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
threatening and cringing&mdash;like a tiger conscious of
his strength, but chilled to the bone at sight of the
trainer&#8217;s whip.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; said the countess, &#8220;but I have an
engagement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who with?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Selden and I are going to lunch at La
Turbie,&#8221; she explained sweetly, but there was a
dangerous gleam in her eye.</p>

<p>Halsey started to say something, but saw the
gleam and checked himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dinner, then?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I am engaged for dinner also. But I shall
be back at five. Call me up,&#8221; and she nodded curtly
and turned definitely away.</p>

<p>Selden, glancing back as they mounted the steps
together, saw that Halsey was still standing there,
hat in hand, staring after them with a look anything
but pleasant. Yes, the fool must be jealous; but
even then he had no right to speak to the countess
so rudely. However, he wasn&#8217;t going to waste any
time over Halsey, and he put him definitely out of
his mind.</p>

<p>He stopped a second at the hotel to order a car
sent on to Eze, and ten minutes later they were in
the funicular, and its little engine was puffing and
panting as it pushed them steeply upward toward
La Turbie, with Monaco and the serrated coast
opening out superbly below.</p>

<p>The carriage was filled with tweed-dad English
on their way to the golf course on Mont Agel, and
the feminine members of the party regarded Selden
and his companion with evident distrust, as of another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
world, while the men seemed loftily unaware
of their existence. It always amused Selden, this
barrier with which the average Englishman tries to
surround himself in public, and he watched now with
a smile as the party, like a herd of deer scenting
danger, drew together into a compact mass and
hastily got the barrier into place.</p>

<p>As he glanced at his companion, he saw that she
was smiling, too, though it might have been with
pleasure at the magnificent panorama opening below
them, upon which her eyes were fixed.</p>

<p>For the first time that morning he had the chance
to take a really good look at her. She had no reason
to fear the light, though there was nothing
girlish about her; indeed, she looked a little older
than she had the night before&mdash;thirty, perhaps.
Every line of her face bespoke the mature woman
of the world, but the flesh was smooth and firm, the
eyes unshadowed, the lips fresh and rounding upward
a little at the corners. It was not so arresting
as when he had first seen it&mdash;that quality had perhaps
been due to art&mdash;but it was still unusual, with
a suggestion of the unplumbed and unfamiliar&mdash;of
age-old jealousies and intrigues and ambitions. It
had race, as distinguished from ancestry. In fact,
Selden doubted if there was any ancestry&mdash;that was
one of the things she would tell him. For he was
determined now that he would have her story&mdash;and
not only her own, but Lappo&#8217;s and Danilo&#8217;s.
He knew exactly where he was going to take her to
unfold it, and exactly what he was going to say.</p>

<p>She felt his eyes upon her face, and glanced at
him, and smiled, and looked away again. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
presently the engine shrieked and panted to a stop
and they clambered out.</p>

<p>Sixteen hundred feet below them Monaco lay
glittering in the sun, while to right and left stretched
the indented coast, from the chersonese beyond
Beaulieu to Bordighera and the Italian hills, with
the blue, blue sea mounting to an horizon which
seemed grey by contrast&mdash;a panorama which, perhaps,
is equalled nowhere on earth.</p>

<p>It still lay below them as they sat at lunch on the
terrace of the hotel, and talked, by tacit consent, of
indifferent things; and presently he had bought her
an iron-tipped cane and they were setting forth
through the little town.</p>

<p>La Turbie is one of those old, old villages built
ages ago along this coast high in the mountain fastnesses
for safety from the Barbary corsairs and the
miscellaneous pirates who roamed up and down the
Mediterranean, raiding and sacking and seeking
what they might devour. It was captured by the
Romans two thousand years ago, and is overshadowed
by the ruins of a great stone tower which
Augustus set up to commemorate the victory. Its
narrow streets and dingy rubble houses have come
unchanged through the ages, and are still inhabited
by the descendants of the old tribes the Romans
conquered, following the same trades in the same
way, and living the same lives.</p>

<p>Except that now they must dodge the motor cars
which flash ceaselessly through the town along the
Grande Corniche. Strangest contrast of the ages,
the silken, jewelled femme du monde who glances
out carelessly at the rough-clad, red-faced girl pushing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
a barrow of manure to the fields. And what
thought stirs the girl&#8217;s brain as she gazes after the
vanishing car?</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps no thought at all,&#8221; said the countess,
when Selden put this question to her. &#8220;Do not make
the mistake of endowing the peasantry with your
own mentality, as so many reformers do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t. And I&#8217;m not a reformer,&#8221; he protested.
&#8220;Just the same, I suppose they have some feelings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Their feelings are centred in their stomachs.
Give them a full stomach and they are happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You talk like Baron Lappo.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I? Well, the baron is a very clever man,
and he understands the peasantry. Nine-tenths of
the people of his country are peasants. Americans
cannot understand them because America has no
peasants. And so you credit them with noble aspirations&mdash;patriotism,
liberty!&mdash;whereas all they really
seek is enough to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; said Selden, &#8220;that you are referring
to those articles of mine which annoyed the baron.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am. I think them altogether mistaken.
I admire your optimism, but it carries you too far.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden glanced at her curiously. He was surprised
that she should speak so earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;According to your idea,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the best
government is the one which gives its people the
most to eat for the least return in labour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; you put it very well. That is it exactly.
How can one believe anything else?&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden turned the idea over in his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;The best government undoubtedly,&#8221; he agreed,
&#8220;is the one that gives every man a square deal.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that is where the old despotisms failed.
They exploited the people for their own benefit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is where every government fails. The people
are always exploited for somebody&#8217;s benefit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At least they have swept away the despotisms&mdash;not
one is left standing in the length and breadth
of Europe. That is why I think Europe&mdash;war-torn,
bankrupt, disordered as she is&mdash;is still better off
to-day than she has ever been, because for the first
time in history her people are free.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they are not free,&#8221; protested the countess
impatiently. &#8220;They are still slaves to their stomachs&mdash;more
than ever, indeed, since food is more
difficult to get. It is absurd to call them free. What
is freedom worth to a starving man? He prefers
food. And he must always have a master.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At least he can choose his master.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But not at all. The peasant can never choose
his master. Do you imagine the Russian peasants
chose Lenin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, of course not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or that the peasants of my own country chose
Jeneski?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something in her voice, a strange
vibrancy, as she uttered the name, which made him
look at her. She was gazing straight ahead, her
nostrils distended with passion, her lips quivering&mdash;and
then suddenly her face changed and she threw
up her hand with a little cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, look there!&#8221;</p>

<p>They had come to a turn in the road&mdash;that marvellous
road, so wide, so perfect, hung miraculously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
against the mountain-side, one of Napoleon&#8217;s masterpieces&mdash;and
below them lay the village of Eze,
unaltered since the Dark Ages.</p>

<p>Its founders, whoever they were, must have had
the fear of pirates driven deep into their souls; perhaps
they came from a town which had been stormed
and looted, and were resolved to run no risk the
second time. So they had chosen for their new
abode the top of a precipitous pinnacle, unapproachable
on any side save one, and almost unapproachable
on that. With unimaginable labour they had
contrived a village there, half dug from the rock,
half built of the rock fragments. At the extreme
summit they had reared a great citadel, as a last
refuge if the town was stormed, and around the
whole they had flung a heavy wall pierced by a
single gate, flanked with defending towers.</p>

<p>So well they built, so solidly, that the town still
stands as it has stood for twenty centuries, the wonder
of the twentieth. Only the citadel, no longer
needed with the passing of the sea-robber, has fallen
into ruin and been despoiled for the repair of the
other houses.</p>

<p>Selden and the countess stood spellbound, gazing
down upon it and upon the marvellous background
against which it is silhouetted&mdash;a background of
hill and water and curving coast; then by a common
impulse they turned into a by-path, and started to
clamber down toward it through the vineyards and
olive groves, past little houses, to the highway&mdash;the
Lower Corniche&mdash;which runs at the foot of the
summit upon which Eze stands; then up again along
a steep and narrow road, through the gateway, past<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
the frowning walls, around the little church, and between
the dismal houses leaning precariously forward
above the steep and narrow passages which
serve as streets&mdash;passages redolent of the Middle
Ages, reeking still with the bloody deeds of Roman
and Lombard, Sicilian and Saracen, Guelph and Ghibelline;
for each in turn held Eze and made of it
the foulest den of thieves in Europe, a haven for the
scoundrels of every land....</p>

<p>Up and up they scrambled, Selden and the countess,
pausing now for breath, now to look at a traceried
window, where once, perhaps, Beatrix of Savoy
had leaned to toss a flower to her sweet troubadour,
Blacasette&mdash;up and up, until they came out upon
what had been the floor of the donjon, but was now
a wide platform open to the sky.</p>

<p>And as they looked around, it seemed that the
whole world lay at their feet.</p>

<p>At one side of the platform, facing the sea, stood
a rude bench.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us sit down,&#8221; said Selden, then got out his
pipe, filled it deliberately, lighted it and took a long
puff. &#8220;Now,&#8221; he added, &#8220;I am ready for the story.&#8221;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII<br />


THE COUNTESS IN ACTION</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FOR a moment the Countess R&eacute;mond did not
speak, and Selden could see that her thoughts
were turned inward, as though seeking some
starting-point, some end to get hold of in the unravelling
of a tangled web. He did not suspect
that, realizing her moment was at hand, she was
gathering her forces to meet it and casting a final
glance over her plan of campaign.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you send for me last night?&#8221; he
prompted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wanted to thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;but there was something else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was going to implore your assistance in saving
a people&#8217;s freedom,&#8221; she answered, smiling as if at
her own impulsiveness.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you no longer need it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I no longer believe their freedom is in danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are speaking of your own people, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean, then, that this new plot of Lappo&#8217;s,
whatever it is, will come to nothing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary, he will succeed; and the country
will be better off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He told you last night what his plans are?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;some of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He expects, of course, to put the king back?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is difficult to take the king seriously,&#8221; said
Selden. &#8220;He has always been a sort of comic-opera
king, posing as the primitive chieftain of a splendid
primitive race.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it was not a pose,&#8221; the countess suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not&mdash;but one can&#8217;t help suspecting a
man with such a genius for publicity. And he was
not always primitive. He was the cleverest intriguer
in Europe; even in the war he tried to be
on both sides at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because he wanted to save his country. How
can one serve a little country like that except by intrigue?&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden took a few reflective puffs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he said at last. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
never met him, so perhaps I&#8217;m prejudiced. But I
do know this&mdash;while he was on the throne, the country
was absolutely his to do as he pleased with. He
was good-natured, democratic, interested in his people&mdash;even
Jeneski admits that!&mdash;but he had his evil
moments when frightful injustices were done. Anybody
who disagreed with him was exiled. But the
principal vice of the whole system was that the
people had no voice in their government.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much voice have they now?&#8221; inquired the
countess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much, I grant you, because they&#8217;re too ignorant.
But as they grow more fit, they&#8217;ll take a
larger and larger part.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps&mdash;if they do not starve meanwhile.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyway,&#8221; added Selden, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t merely a question<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
of the old king. Nobody would object if he
could gather up a few millions somewhere and go
back and spend them on his country. But he won&#8217;t
live long, and then it will be a question of Danilo.
What about him? Is he the sort of man to save a
country from starvation?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He would have Lappo,&#8221; pointed out the countess.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a shame,&#8221; mused Selden, &#8220;that Lappo can&#8217;t
work with Jeneski. What a team that would
make!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he cannot,&#8221; said the countess. &#8220;He would
consider himself a traitor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two fell silent, gazing thoughtfully out over
the sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have told me nothing about yourself,&#8221; he
said at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want to know?&#8221; and she cast him a quick
glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help wondering....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About that man you discovered signalling to the
Germans?&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden nodded without looking at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;That man was Lappo&#8217;s son,&#8221; said the countess.</p>

<p>Selden stared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lappo&#8217;s son?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The son of a woman he loved very much. He
had made a state marriage&mdash;a very unhappy one&mdash;and
had a legitimate son, so he could not acknowledge
the other. But he got for him a little estate
and the courtesy title of Count R&eacute;mond. Afterwards
he had reason to be glad he had not acknowledged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
him, for R&eacute;mond&#8217;s mother died, and he developed
a streak of madness, became involved in
frightful scandals and was finally sent to America.
Practically all our people in America had settled in
one place&mdash;at a little town in Montana where there
was a great copper mine. R&eacute;mond came there. We
met each other and&mdash;were married. He was not
without fascination of a sort&mdash;and I was very young.
Then came the war, and R&eacute;mond was soon travelling
about the country in what he told me was the Allies&#8217;
secret service. I saw him very little. When America
entered the war, he enlisted. I was very proud
of him. I never suspected what he was really doing
until I heard....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how could you hear?&#8221; asked Selden. &#8220;It
was a military secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The baron found out. He had sources of information.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he knows....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That you were the one who denounced R&eacute;mond?
But of course!&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden involuntarily glanced behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do not fear,&#8221; said the countess with a smile.
&#8220;He is glad the traitor was caught so soon. He
may even speak to you about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, that would be like the baron! Here, then,
was one of the skeletons concealed in his private
closet! Selden wondered how many more there
were.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, at last, &#8220;and afterwards?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Afterwards,&#8221; the countess paused an instant;
&#8220;afterwards the baron was very kind to me. He
sent me money, he invited me to place myself under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
his protection&mdash;but he himself was soon an exile, for
the Austrians overran the country, and he had time
to think only of his king. So it was not until Jeneski
came back that I could return.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You came with Jeneski?&#8221; asked Selden curiously,
wondering what the baron had thought of that.</p>

<p>The countess nodded, her lip caught between her
teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;He and my father had been dear friends,&#8221; she
explained. &#8220;When my father died, Jeneski in a
way adopted me. So he took me back with him, and
succeeded in having my little estate restored to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>A very seductive adopted daughter, Selden
thought; a rather disturbing one. The countess&#8217;s
story had rung true up to this point, but here it was
not quite convincing.</p>

<p>&#8220;The estate&mdash;it is an attractive one, I hope?&#8221;
he queried.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not bad&mdash;but I could not stay there.&#8221; The
note of passion was in her voice again, and her hands
were clenched. &#8220;It was impossible. I could not do
it. So I came away to Paris&mdash;to Monte Carlo&mdash;to
amuse myself&mdash;to forget!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One can amuse oneself better here, that is true,&#8221;
Selden agreed, searching for a clue to her emotion.
&#8220;But weren&#8217;t you interested in seeing how Jeneski&#8217;s
experiment works out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jeneski!&#8221; she repeated hoarsely. &#8220;Ah, you do
not know him! He is not a man&mdash;he is a machine
which crushes people who get in his way. He....&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped abruptly, struggling for self-control.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Selden, &#8220;I suppose all fanatics are
more or less like that.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>&#8220;I have known some who were human,&#8221; said the
countess more quietly, and closed her lips tightly,
as though determined to say no more.</p>

<p>Selden could only ponder what she meant. How
had she got in his way? What had he done to her?
To him Jeneski had seemed very human&mdash;possessed
by his idea, of course, ready to make for it any sacrifice;
but full of fire, of sympathy, of understanding.
Full of passion, too, unless his full red lips belied
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;However,&#8221; the countess was saying, &#8220;we need
not concern ourselves about Jeneski. He will soon
be replaced.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not so sure of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Baron Lappo is sure of it. I do not think you
understand, Mr. Selden, what an extraordinary man
the baron is. Nothing is concealed from him. He
is in his way a great artist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope to know him better,&#8221; Selden observed.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the king&mdash;he is not at all what you think.
But you will see!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;the baron has promised to arrange an interview.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be to-night; the baron is giving a dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you know?&#8221; asked Selden, looking at
her in some astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am to be there. You also are invited, are you
not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;you can make your observations! I advise
you to keep your eyes very wide open.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden rubbed a reflective hand across his forehead.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>&#8220;I confess,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that these intrigues are too
subtle for my intelligence. I don&#8217;t seem to be able
to find the key. However I shall do my best. I
don&#8217;t suppose you can tell me any more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only in confidence. You would not want that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; agreed Selden slowly, &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t want
that. I must be free to use whatever I find out, if I
think it necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand, and you are right,&#8221; she nodded,
and glanced at her watch. &#8220;Come, we must be
going. This dinner is a most important one for me.
I must dress for it carefully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know who will be there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The king, Danilo, Lappo, yourself, myself, and&mdash;two
or three other women.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame Ghita, perhaps?&#8221; hazarded Selden, and
watched her face.</p>

<p>She could not suppress a little start.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know Madame Ghita?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She was enquiring for the prince at the Sporting
Club last night. I happened to hear her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said the countess; &#8220;then of course you can
guess who she is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose so,&#8221; said Selden slowly, with a
little sinking of the heart. He had hoped against
hope that there might be some other explanation.
Ah, well, if she were Danilo&#8217;s mistress that ended it.</p>

<p>The countess was looking at him curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you knew perfectly well that she will not
be at the dinner to-night. Were you setting a trap
of some sort?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;but I wondered who she was. I wasn&#8217;t
sure.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>&#8220;Well, you are now!&#8221; she said, and held out her
hand to him, and he helped her down the rocky
descent to the town. She permitted herself to lean
against him once or twice, but he was too preoccupied
to notice. Madame Ghita&mdash;the mistress of the
prince!</p>

<p>The countess looked at him occasionally, trying to
read his thoughts, but she did not speak again until
they were seated in the motor-car which was awaiting
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;You saw the prince last night?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I went over to the Sporting Club after I
finished my work. The prince was playing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And losing, of course?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he was winning heavily. He must have won
two hundred thousand francs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was he alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, there was a young fellow named Davis with
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An American?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;obviously.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it was from him he got the money!&#8221; she murmured,
half to herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; laughed Selden. &#8220;Do you know
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I have never met him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is very young and callow, but I fancy he will
get plenty of experience before long. First from the
prince, and then from a girl who has him in her net.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did the baron see him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; he seemed to know him quite well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he was very much annoyed, was he not?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>Selden looked at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you know that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I guessed it! But please go on and tell me
what happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The principal thing that happened,&#8221; said Selden,
laughing a little at the recollection, &#8220;was that the
baron made the prince repay the money he had borrowed&mdash;a
considerable sum. The prince was very
much annoyed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He would be,&#8221; nodded the countess. &#8220;He has
always found more amusing uses for his money than
paying his debts with it. It must have been a new
experience! But in this case it was necessary,&#8221; she
added, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad you understand it so well,&#8221; said Selden
drily.</p>

<p>The countess laughed and tapped his hand playfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not be cross,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You will find it
much more amusing to piece together the puzzle for
yourself. And I am sure you will find the key at the
dinner to-night!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not cross; I am only wondering if I shall
see you to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>She glanced at him from under lowered lashes.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you wish,&#8221; she said softly.</p>

<p>He moved a little nearer to her. Since Madame
Ghita was unattainable, and this amusement offered....</p>

<p>&#8220;When will you be free?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;All day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we say dinner, then, at Ciro&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>&#8220;That will be lovely!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Selden. &#8220;You are being very
nice to me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I have a good heart!&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;And
perhaps I have some secret reason!&#8221;</p>

<p>They were speeding down the slope into the Condamine,
when another motor panted past them so
rapidly that Selden caught but a glimpse of its occupant.
But his companion&#8217;s eyes had been quicker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you see who that was?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was Madame Ghita. And this is the road to
Nice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is at Nice the dinner is to take place!&#8221;
cried the countess. &#8220;Surely you are not so stupid
as you seem!&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden could only look at her. And suddenly the
car jerked to a stop.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have arrived,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Till to-night&mdash;and
thank you for a delightful afternoon!&#8221;</p>

<p>And she ran quickly up the steps into the hotel.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX<br />


A KING&#8217;S APOLOGIA</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SELDEN dressed for dinner that evening with
the same sense of nervous tension that he used
to feel in the old days when tumbling out of
bed and hustling into his clothes in the middle of the
night to witness the jump-off of a big offensive. He
had found a note from the baron awaiting him,
naming 8:30 as the hour and the Villa Gloria on the
Promenade des Anglais as the place, and expressing
great pleasure that Selden was to be among the
guests. Its perfect wording awakened in Selden
fresh admiration for the supreme finish of the old
diplomat, who was never at fault for the right word,
the right look, the right gesture.</p>

<p>And presently, alone in a compartment of the express
which hurtled through innumerable tunnels
towards Nice, he had settled himself in a corner and
endeavoured to draw such deductions as were possible
from his afternoon&#8217;s conversation with the
countess, and to decide how much of it was grist for
his mill.</p>

<p>There was a plot, it seemed, to get the old king
back on the throne. But that was nothing new.
There had always been such a plot, ever since the
day when the king and his family and a few adherents
had been forced to flee the country. A plot was
taken so much for granted, and seemed so certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
to prove futile, that nobody gave it a second thought.
Hitherto it had gathered to a head whenever the
king was in extraordinary need of funds, and had
faded away again as soon as the funds were secured
from some too-credulous speculator.</p>

<p>But this time it seemed to be unusually serious,
and involved, so the baron had hinted, not only the
restoration of the king, but the financing of the
country. Heaven knows it needed financing, and no
doubt the baron was right&mdash;the king would be welcomed
back with open arms, if only he brought some
money with him. There was no doubt that he had
won an immense personal popularity during his half
century of power. Most of his subjects had never
known any other ruler, and probably desired no
other. He had mixed with them as a father with
his children&mdash;an old-world father, to be sure, whose
word was law. He had become a court of last resort
to which his subjects were forever appealing to
settle their disputes, especially their domestic disputes&mdash;a
court the more highly esteemed because no
fees were exacted, though the gift of a lamb, or a
dozen chickens, or a crock of butter, was always appreciated.</p>

<p>He had lived in a state of patriarchal simplicity,
carefully contrived and adroitly advertised, so that
the peasant woman baked her bread with the pleasant
consciousness that the queen baked hers also,
and when some shopkeeper or petty farmer compared
the time with the king in the public square of
the capital, he saw that the king&#8217;s watch was of brass
like his own. When he went to the bank to make a
little deposit, he was as likely as not to encounter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
the king there, also putting aside a portion of his
savings.</p>

<p>Moreover this far-seeing monarch had not relied
on popular prestige alone, but had further strengthened
his position by marrying his ten children into
most of the courts of Europe. For his eldest son
he had chosen a Hohenzollern princess; his eldest
daughter was now queen of a dominion far larger
than her father&#8217;s; two other daughters had captured
Russian Grand Dukes; and a strange turn of fortune,
combined with a bloody tragedy, had brought
a grandson to a throne.</p>

<p>So, if any king could be safe, he had seemed to be&mdash;and
yet all these safeguards had been swept away
by the World War. The passion for democracy
which emerged from it had decreed that kings must
go, and Pietro had found himself cast aside with all
the others. But a revulsion had already begun; the
feeling was growing that an ordered government,
however despotic, was better than a disordered one,
however ideal in theory; and kings and princes,
exiled in Switzerland or Holland or along the Riviera,
were beginning to pick up heart of hope and
gather their partisans about them.</p>

<p>Yet, Selden told himself, sitting there and turning
all this over in his mind, despite the fact that this
revulsion was being sedulously fostered by financiers
and aristocrats and every one else who had been
despoiled of money or power by the new order,
there was not the slightest hope for any of them,
except perhaps for this one canny old patriarch.
Certainly there was no hope for the pompous coward
at Doorn or the perjured neurasthenic at Lucerne.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
But for this old autocrat&mdash;well, perhaps, if he could
get hold of enough money to organize an opposition
and carry on a campaign. No doubt many of his
mountaineers thought he was still ruling over them!</p>

<p>The train creaked to a stop under the great glass-roofed
shed at Nice, and Selden clambered down to
the platform and made his way through the exit to
the street. He saw that it was only a minute or two
past eight, so he drew his coat about him and started
to walk.</p>

<p>For the first time since the outbreak of the war
Nice was experiencing a really prosperous season,
and it had gone to the head of that mercurial city.
The newly-named Avenue des Victoires hummed
with traffic, the side-walks were crowded with chattering
people, happy again in having a host of
strangers to despoil. The gorgeous shops on either
side were a blaze of light, with their choicest wares
displayed in their windows. They were devoted almost
entirely to articles de luxe, and they seemed to
Selden, as he glanced into them, more luxurious and
far more expensive than ever.</p>

<p>Where the money came from no one knew, but
vaster sums than ever before were being frittered
away on articles of vanity and personal adornment.
The wealth of the world seemed to have
passed suddenly into the hands of women, who were
flinging it recklessly to right and left. The season
at Deauville had been marked by an extravagance
wild beyond parallel, by such gambling as the world
had never seen. Now it was here, along the Riviera,
that the orgy was continued. And not here only, as
he well knew, but in Paris, London, Brussels, Berlin&mdash;yes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
even in Vienna and Budapest and Warsaw,
before the eyes of starving spectators&mdash;the dance
whirled on. Thoughtful men looked on aghast, but
no one was wise enough to foretell how or when it
would end. That the end would be disaster Selden
did not for a moment doubt. He even looked forward
to it with a certain pleasure!</p>

<p>The crowds in the street had delayed him a little,
so at the Place Mass&eacute;na he called a cab and gave
the driver the address. In a moment they were clattering
along the Promenade des Anglais, before a
row of stately white villas and great hotels, looking
out across the wide cement promenade upon the
magic sea which stretched away to the horizon.</p>

<p>The Villa Gloria proved to be one of the most
imposing of these edifices, with entrance barred by
high iron gates, which were passed only after Selden
had given his name and it had been duly checked
upon a list in the hands of the concierge, who took
a good look at him, evidently suspicious of any one
arriving in a public cab. The establishment was
plainly an elaborate one&mdash;maintained, so gossip said,
from the private purse of the daughter who still retained
a throne.</p>

<p>His hat and coat were taken from him by a
bearded functionary in the native costume&mdash;which,
to American eyes, savours so much of the bull-ring!&mdash;and
another led the way up a wide stair, opened a
door and announced him.</p>

<p>The room he entered was evidently the salon,
but it was deserted except for the Baron Lappo,
who was hastening forward across its empty spaces.
Selden, rather taken aback, wondered uneasily if he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
could have mistaken the hour, but if he had, there
was no sign of it in the baron&#8217;s greeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a great pleasure to see you again,&#8221; he was
saying. &#8220;I have spoken of you to the king, and he
is most desirous of meeting you. I shall take you to
him at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden murmured his thanks and followed the
baron down the length of the long room to a door
at the other end. The baron knocked and, a voice
bidding him enter, opened the door and motioned
Selden to precede him. Stepping through, Selden
found himself in a little room, blue with tobacco
smoke, which was evidently the king&#8217;s work cabinet.
An imposing figure was seated at a desk near the
window, and a secretary with a sheaf of papers was
just making his escape through an opposite door.</p>

<p>Lappo led him forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is M. Selden, Your Majesty,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The figure at the desk rose to its feet&mdash;an impressive
height.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to meet you, sir,&#8221; said the king, in
excellent English. &#8220;I have heard much of you and
congratulate you upon your brilliant achievements.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden, considerably abashed by this greeting, had
the impression that he was shaking hands with an
institution rather than with a man. The Institution
of Royalty. He murmured something and sat down,
in obedience to the king&#8217;s gesture. The king also
reseated himself, his chair creaking loudly, but the
baron remained standing.</p>

<p>Selden had seen a good many kings in the course
of his career, but none who looked the part as this
one did. The tall and dignified King of the Belgians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
was the closest second, but he lacked the picturesqueness,
the air of mastery and profundity, which
marked this old man. He sat there as though he
ruled the world; he imposed himself.</p>

<p>He wore, as always, the costume of his country,
rich and colourful with embroidery, and for head-covering
a flat round brimless cap of blood-red satin,
with his arms in gold upon the front. It became
oddly his dark, semi-oriental countenance, with its
hawk-nose, its grizzled moustache drooping on either
side the full lips, and its deeply cleft chin. But it
was the eyes which impressed Selden most. They
were very dark and very large, and had a peculiar
cast, or lack of focus, which gave them the effect of
looking not at one, but into and through one and
out on the other side, distinctly disconcerting until
one grew used to it. Indeed, just at first, Selden
had the impression that the king was gazing fixedly
at some one behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you will not mind,&#8221; went on the king, &#8220;if
I speak in French. I speak English, it is true, and
I have insisted that all of my children should learn
that language, though I regret to say that some of
them forgot, as they forgot other of my teachings,
after they left my house. But I have not in it the
precision which I have in French.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It astonishes me, sir, that you speak English so
well,&#8221; said Selden. &#8220;I found very few people in the
Balkans who could speak it at all, unless they had
lived in America.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, monsieur,&#8221; said the king, a little sadly,
&#8220;when one&#8217;s kingdom is so small that from its centre
one can see almost to its borders, and when beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
those borders are age-old enemies searching ceaselessly
for an avenue of attack, one must take care
to neglect nothing. As you perhaps know, I have
had six daughters and four sons. Yes, I believe in
large families,&#8221; he added, with a smile. &#8220;I once
had a most interesting discussion upon that subject
with your great Roosevelt. We found ourselves in
entire accord. I wish I could have married one of
my girls to one of his boys&mdash;it would have been for
the good of the race!&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden nodded his agreement. Yes, that would
have been a new strain! He was more and more
fascinated by this astonishing old man.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what I wished to say,&#8221; went on the king,
&#8220;was this&mdash;that since my kingdom was such a small
one&mdash;small, you understand, monsieur, in size, but
very great in spirit, in tradition and in pride&mdash;it was
necessary that I strengthen myself wherever possible
by alliances. So my children were taught many languages,
English among them, and since I could not
permit them to be wiser than their father, I was
forced to learn them too, though of course I learned
them much less readily. But the effort they cost me
has been many times repaid by the ability they gave
me to converse with men of many nations, whose
minds would otherwise have remained closed to me,
and to read many things of which otherwise I should
have been ignorant&mdash;your interesting articles upon
my country, for example, and upon Austria and central
Europe in general. I congratulate you again
upon them&mdash;their point of view is not always mine,
but I can see that they have been based upon an accuracy
of observation and breadth of sympathy altogether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
unusual. Will you have a cigarette? No?
Tobacco is my one dissipation&mdash;I am getting too old
for any other.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took a fat Turkish cigarette from a case on
his desk, lighted it carefully, and blew an immense
gust of smoke toward the ceiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;When my good Lappo told me this morning of
having met you yesterday,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;and suggested
that you be asked this evening half an hour
in advance of the other guests, I thought it a most
happy idea. Lappo has many happy ideas,&#8221; with a
smile at the baron. &#8220;I should be lost without him.
Having read your articles, I welcomed the opportunity
to explain to you something of my point of
view. It is no secret that I am trying to regain my
kingdom, of which I have been unjustly deprived. I
shall continue to try until I succeed, or until I die.
It is a point of honour with me. But I infer from
your articles that you would not be sympathetic toward
such a restoration?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me, sir,&#8221; Selden answered, &#8220;that the
republican form of government is best for any people,
because it opens the way for opportunity and
self-development. And I do not believe in the hereditary
right to rule&mdash;to dispose of people&#8217;s lives and
fortunes, and to control their happiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not see,&#8221; said the king, &#8220;that the hereditary
right to rule differs in principle from the hereditary
right to property. Because this right is sometimes
abused, I do not suppose that you would abolish it
altogether?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Selden, &#8220;I have not yet got quite as
far as Communism. But I think hereditary fortunes&mdash;all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
wealth, indeed&mdash;should be limited and
controlled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So should the hereditary right to rule be limited
and controlled&mdash;as it is in England, perhaps. Ah,
I can see what you are thinking,&#8221; added the king,
with a smile. &#8220;You are thinking that deposed monarchs
are always democrats; that I am a new convert
to this idea&mdash;but there you are wrong. I gave my
people a constitution long ago. It was not as liberal
as England&#8217;s, true; but one cannot scale a mountain
at a single bound. One must climb step by step.
Even republics are not always perfect!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they never are!&#8221; Selden agreed. &#8220;They
sometimes do disgraceful things&mdash;unaccountable
things&mdash;ours has in turning its back on Europe. But
however ignorant and selfish they may appear, they
are nevertheless a step forward toward the liberation
of mankind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps so; but I repeat that it may sometimes
be too long a step to take safely all at once. My
argument, monsieur, is this: One cannot suddenly
give complete liberty to a people who for centuries
have been accustomed to guidance and control without
running the risk of very grave disaster. Civilization
is the result of people working together, of a
vast co-ordination. When government fails, and the
people fall apart into little groups, each working for
itself, civilization fails too. Rather than take such
a risk, the wise man proceeds slowly and with caution&mdash;he
seeks to lead the people upward gradually,
a small step at a time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is true, sir,&#8221; agreed Selden. &#8220;The trouble
is that in the past they have often not been led upward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
at all, but kept ground down in the mud at the
bottom of the pit by the fear and the greed of their
rulers. If they have progressed, it has been in spite
of their rulers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the past, perhaps; not in the future. That
day, monsieur, will never return. The war has liberated
the world from slavery to old forms and old
ideas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe so with all my heart,&#8221; said Selden.
&#8220;Our task is to keep it from sliding back again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the war was not able to make men wise all
at once,&#8221; said the king. &#8220;So we must also take care
not to become the slaves of new ideas which are
worse than the old ones, or which are really only the
old ones cleverly disguised with a new name. There
will always be in the world, monsieur, men who seek
wealth and power for unscrupulous and selfish ends.
As I look about me at the present state of Europe,
I fear sometimes that it is falling into the hands of
such men. I fear....&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a tap at the door. The king glanced
at a little clock on his desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;The other guests are arriving,&#8221; he said, and rose.
&#8220;I have enjoyed our talk very much, M. Selden, and
especially your frankness. We must continue it
sometime. Meanwhile I confide you to the good
Lappo,&#8221; and he bowed with the most engaging cordiality.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X<br />


THE BOMB BURSTS</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SELDEN was conscious of a distinct liking and
admiration for the old monarch as he watched
him hasten forward to meet the new arrivals,
two women and a man.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is M. Davis, with his mother and his sister,&#8221;
explained the baron, who had remained behind a
moment until the king&#8217;s greetings were over.</p>

<p>Selden saw with some astonishment that it was
indeed the same young Davis whom he had met at
the Sporting Club the night before. Why should
the king invite these Americans to dinner? And especially
why should he welcome them so warmly&mdash;with
such graciousness combined with patriarchal
dignity? Why should he pat Miss Davis&#8217;s hand as
though he were her father? What was the meaning
of the baron&#8217;s faultless deference? Who were these
Davises, anyway?</p>

<p>These questions flashed through his head in the
moment during which the king bent over the hands
of the ladies and inquired solicitously about their
health. Then it was the baron&#8217;s turn; and then
Davis turned and saw Selden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, hello,&#8221; he said, and came over and shook
hands. &#8220;Sis will be tickled to death to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the king, whom nothing escaped, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
who had evidently been coached by his good Lappo,
&#8220;I felt certain that Miss Davis would be glad to
meet so distinguished a countryman&mdash;and you also,
madame,&#8221; and he brought Selden forward and introduced
him.</p>

<p>The elder woman surveyed him through her lorgnette,
evidently wondering who he was, and her
greeting was perfunctory in the extreme, but when
he shook hands with her daughter, he found himself
looking into a pair of eyes fairly dancing with excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I am glad to meet you.
Your articles seem to me perfectly wonderful. I
have read them all!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a great compliment,&#8221; said Selden, laughing
a little at her enthusiasm. &#8220;I doubt if there is
any one else who has read them all! You are interested
in politics, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there was much more than politics&mdash;but I
liked them especially because they were so&mdash;so
brave, so optimistic.&#8221;</p>

<p>The baron had drawn near and was listening
smilingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too much so perhaps,&#8221; said Selden, with a glance
at him. &#8220;That, at least, is the opinion of M. le
Baron.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no; you do me wrong!&#8221; protested the baron.
&#8220;I think merely that there is a safer road up the
mountain than the one you indicate&mdash;at least up the
mountains of my country, which is very mountainous
indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And perhaps you are right, M. le Baron,&#8221; agreed
Selden, amiably.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>Miss Davis had been listening with an intensity
which puzzled him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to be quite sure that I understand,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;M. le Baron and I have talked a great deal
about your point of view. His idea is that the old
r&eacute;gime could do much more for his country than is
possible under the new one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If the old r&eacute;gime adopted some new ideas, and
could arrange to finance the country, he is probably
right,&#8221; Selden conceded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, mademoiselle, you see!&#8221; cried the baron, obviously
elated. &#8220;It is as I told you! But come, the
king has something to say to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>What the king had to say seemed of a semi-confidential,
not to say romantic, nature; at least Miss
Davis laughed and blushed and shook her head.
Left to himself for a moment, Selden had an opportunity
to examine the two women.</p>

<p>As for the mother, her origin, character and ambitions
were written large all over her&mdash;in her plump
face with its insignificant features and bright little
eyes like a bird&#8217;s; in the figure, too fat, too tightly
corseted; in the voice, too loud and not quite sure
of its grammar; in the gown, too elaborate, and the
jewels, too abundant&mdash;a woman who had once, no
doubt, been a good sort with a certain dignity and
genuineness, but who had been spoiled by prosperity
and also, perhaps, by a careless and too-indulgent
husband&mdash;an American husband. Selden could see
him, in company with countless others, labouring
away at home to make the money which his wife and
family were frittering away on the pleasure-grounds
of Europe!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>The boy was curiously like her, but the daughter
was of a different and much finer type, and Selden
guessed that she carried on the father&#8217;s strain. Not
strikingly beautiful, but fresh-skinned and wholesome,
with a face delicately chiselled and touched
just the slightest, when in repose, by sadness or disillusion&mdash;just
a little too old and too reserved for
its years; in this respect more of Europe than of
America. Perhaps it was the mother who had disillusioned
her....</p>

<p>But why should the king listen to them both with
such attention? Why should the baron be so deferential?
Could it be possible that these people had
something to do with the plot?</p>

<p>The baron, seeing Selden standing alone, managed
to guide him back to Mrs. Davis, whose cool greeting
he had noted, and for which he proceeded at
once to atone.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not often we have with us a man of such
wide influence as M. Selden,&#8221; he began.</p>

<p>&#8220;The baron exaggerates,&#8221; Selden hastened to assure
her. &#8220;I am just a newspaper man, Mrs.
Davis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Mrs. Davis, using her lorgnette again.
Her experiences with newspaper men had not always
been fortunate, and she distrusted them.</p>

<p>&#8220;But a newspaper man, as you call it, the most
distinguished,&#8221; the baron persisted. &#8220;Perhaps you
have heard your daughter and myself discussing
some of his theories.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I have,&#8221; she agreed uncertainly.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. Selden is a democrat the most pronounced,&#8221;
went on the baron, no whit discouraged; &#8220;but we are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
trying to convince him that a monarchy also may
have its virtues.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure there is little to be said for democracies,&#8221;
said Mrs. Davis severely, as one lecturing a
small child, &#8220;when one sees their horrible blunders.
And such men!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They do blunder,&#8221; Selden agreed; &#8220;but at least
it is their own blunders they suffer from, so there is
a sort of poetic justice in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it is other people who suffer,&#8221; said Mrs.
Davis. &#8220;They rob every one. When I think that
my income tax this year....&#8221;</p>

<p>She was interrupted by the announcement of the
Countess R&eacute;mond, and was instantly so absorbed in
contemplation of that unusual woman that she quite
forgot to go on.</p>

<p>The Countess R&eacute;mond had said that she was going
to dress with care, but Selden had foreseen no
such finished perfection, and moreover it was at once
apparent that she was as much at home in a king&#8217;s
drawing-room as in any other. Nothing could have
been more correct, more perfect, than the way she
acknowledged the introduction to the king which the
baron made. The king himself regarded her with
an appreciative eye, for he had always been a connoisseur
of women, holding her hand the tiniest fraction
of a second longer than was necessary, and took
advantage of the moment when the baron was continuing
the introductions to motion the major-domo
to him and give him some brief instructions in an
undertone. As that solemn functionary bowed and
hastened away, Selden guessed that the king had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
suddenly decided upon a rearrangement of the places
at table.</p>

<p>The way in which the countess greeted the ladies
was also a work of art, it was so charming, so cordial,
so gracious, without a trace of that arrogance
which alas! too often marks the bearing of ladies of
the old world toward ladies of the new, and which
indeed one might well expect of a countess. Her
indifference to the men was almost as marked; she
acknowledged their presence with the coolest of
nods, and turned back at once to the women as far
more interesting. The elder, flattered, almost inarticulate,
was already at her feet, and the younger
was visibly impressed. The countess was confiding
to them something about her gown&mdash;the clumsiness
of maids....</p>

<p>Selden noted the satisfied smile which the baron
could not wholly repress, the energetic way in which
he polished his glass. Evidently the countess was
playing the game&mdash;whatever the game might be&mdash;very
much to his liking.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard so much of you and of your daughter
from my old friend, Baron Lappo,&#8221; the countess
continued to the enraptured Mrs. Davis, speaking
with a pronounced and very taking accent which
Selden had not heretofore noted in her speech.
&#8220;Permit me to say that your daughter is lovely&mdash;the
true queenly type!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Davis sputtered her delight. Her daughter
blushed crimson. Selden gaped a little at the adjective.
Queenly&mdash;now what did she mean by that?
And looking at the countess more closely, he saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
that in some way she had subtly altered her appearance;
her face seemed longer, her eyes had a little
slant, her lips were not so full....</p>

<p>&#8220;I see you are not accustomed to such frankness,&#8221;
she rattled on; &#8220;but I am frank or nothing. If I
think nice things about people, I believe in saying
them&mdash;yes, even to their faces; ugly ones, also,
sometimes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you talk almost like an American!&#8221; cried
Mrs. Davis.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was in America I learned my English,&#8221; the
countess explained. &#8220;I was there with my parents
as a girl. At Washington.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Davis had a vision of the countess&#8217;s father
as a great diplomat. But Selden had another start.
She had not mentioned Washington to him that
afternoon; she had spoken only of Montana.</p>

<p>Miss Davis had been looking at the countess intently,
with startled eyes, as though striving to recall
some memory.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be so glad to talk to you about it,&#8221;
added the countess. She had noticed the girl&#8217;s intent
look, and turned full face to her, so that she got
all the benefit of the slanting eyes and the thin,
arched brows. &#8220;Perhaps you will have tea with
me....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have tea with us!&#8221; cried Mrs. Davis.
&#8220;To-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you wish,&#8221; assented the countess with a gracious
smile, which included the younger woman.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the king and the baron had been consulting
together in undertones; from their aspect it
was evident that something had gone amiss.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>&#8220;I was forced to send Danilo on an important errand
this afternoon,&#8221; said the king finally, &#8220;and he
has not yet returned. He has had an accident perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I hope not!&#8221; cried Mrs. Davis. &#8220;That
would be too terrible!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If any one was injured,&#8221; said the king with a
smile, &#8220;it was undoubtedly some one else, in which
case he would be detained only until he had satisfied
the police. But I do not think we shall wait any longer.
Baron, will you summon the Princess Anna?&#8221;</p>

<p>The baron disappeared and presently returned
with a tall young lady on his arm. She was perhaps
twenty-five, very dark, with a perceptible moustache,
and very thin.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my youngest daughter, Anna,&#8221; said the
king, &#8220;named, as all my daughters were, for one of
the great saints of my country.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Princess Anna bowed to the guests without
taking her hand from the baron&#8217;s arm. She, at least,
seemed to have no reason to ingratiate herself with
the rich Americans!</p>

<p>The king nodded, and the doors at the end of the
room swung back, disclosing the gleaming table beyond.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I have the honour, madame?&#8221; and he offered
his arm to Mrs. Davis.</p>

<p>Selden permitted young Davis to take the countess,
and followed with the sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you really in earnest a moment ago?&#8221; she
inquired in a low voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;In earnest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;in saying the baron might be right?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>&#8220;Why, yes; entirely so,&#8221; he answered, puzzled by
the intensity of her look.</p>

<p>She took a deep breath and turned her head away
for an instant.</p>

<p>And then they were at the table.</p>

<p>When they were seated, he found himself still at
her right. Beyond her was a vacant place, evidently
for Danilo, while beyond that, and to the right of
the king, sat the countess. Selden smiled to find his
surmise correct&mdash;even at eighty, the king had not
lost interest in pretty women!</p>

<p>Mrs. Davis was at the king&#8217;s left, while beyond
her, the baron, the Princess Anna and young Davis,
who had been adroitly detached from the countess,
completed the company.</p>

<p>The king, with patriarchal dignity, asked grace in
his native tongue, somewhat to the confusion of his
guests. Selden could see Mrs. Davis regarding with
a startled eye the red cap which the king made no
motion to remove. Then came the soup, and she
was startled again to see the Princess Anna rise and
serve her father.</p>

<p>&#8220;In our country,&#8221; the king explained, with a smile,
seeing her glance, &#8220;it is the custom for the daughters
to serve their parents. I consider it a very good
custom, and my daughters have always followed it.
As you know,&#8221; he went on, tasting the soup with an
approving smack of the lips, &#8220;I have a daughter who
is a queen, but when she comes to visit her father,
she still gives him to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>The picture of a queen ladling out the soup was
too much for Mrs. Davis, and she gasped audibly.
Or perhaps it was the soup, which she at that moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
tasted. The king had brought his native chef
with him from Goritza, and this soupe &agrave; l&#8217;oignon
was one of his masterpieces, but it was rather a
shock to the unaccustomed palate, especially if the
cheese was a little strong. But since it came from a
royal kitchen, Mrs. Davis battled with it manfully.
The king asked for a second serving.</p>

<p>It was at that moment the prince appeared.</p>

<p>Selden was sure he had never looked more handsome.
His eyes were shining; his dark skin, usually
a little sallow, was most becomingly flushed. He
seemed in the gayest possible mood&mdash;even a reckless
mood.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, do not rise,&#8221; said the king to his guests, motioned
the prince to his side and put to him a stern
question in his native tongue. The prince replied
expansively; for an instant a scowl of displeasure
threatened the king&#8217;s countenance, then he smiled
blandly round upon the company.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was as I thought,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Fortunately no
one was killed. Make your apologies, sir, to the
ladies.&#8221;</p>

<p>The prince, with a mocking light in his eyes, bent
over Mrs. Davis, and raised her plump hand to his
lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was really impatience to be with you, madame,
which caused the accident,&#8221; he said gaily. &#8220;A speed
too swift&mdash;a road slippery from the rain....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what a fib!&#8221; broke in the lady, tapping him
playfully with her lorgnette. But never for an instant
did she suspect how great a fib it was!</p>

<p>The prince made his other greetings swiftly, then
dropped into the seat beside Miss Davis, kissed her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
fingers as he had her mother&#8217;s, and spoke a low sentence
into her ear. And Selden, noting the quick flush
which swept across her cheek, noting the baron&#8217;s attentive
eyes, noting the king&#8217;s benignant good-humour,
understood in that instant the whole plot.</p>

<p>For a flash his eyes met those of the Countess
R&eacute;mond, who was smiling cynically, maliciously, as
though at some long-cherished vengeance about to
be accomplished. Then he turned back to his plate,
his heart hot with resentment. It was horrible that
a girl like that should be sacrificed to the ambitions
of a worldly mother! No wonder she was disillusioned!
And to a libertine like the prince! Of
that, of course, she could have no suspicion, and she
would find it out too late. Of happiness there was
not the slightest possibility.</p>

<p>Yet&mdash;was there not? He looked again at Myra
Davis&mdash;there was something in her face that said
she was not a fool, that she had had some experience
of the world, so she must know something of the
ways of princes. And it would be exciting to be the
wife of a man like that&mdash;to be compelled to hold
one&#8217;s place against all the other women....</p>

<p>And he would teach her many things.</p>

<p>Of love, as the average American understood it&mdash;mutual
trust, mutual respect, common interests, fidelity,
placid affection&mdash;nothing at all; but there
would be bursts of passion, shattering experiences,
and if she were strong enough to survive being cast
down from the heights from time to time, she might
win through, might in the end even hold him. At
least she might find such a life more interesting than
the placidity of the meadows. There was always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
that choice in life between emotion and tranquillity,
and Selden had never been able to make up his mind
which was the wiser.</p>

<p>To be a queen&mdash;even an unhappy one&mdash;even of
a tiny kingdom....</p>

<p>But what of Madame Ghita? Did she know of
this? Was that why they had met her driving toward
Nice? Did she intend to interfere?</p>

<p>And was it conceivable that any man would leave
a woman like that?</p>

<p>Probably the prince had no intention of leaving
her&mdash;and again Selden glowed with indignation.
But he was conscious, deep down in his heart, that
his indignation was not so much for the girl at his
side as for that other woman, about to be deserted,
or, worse still, compelled to share....</p>

<p>He awoke abruptly to the knowledge that Miss
Davis was addressing him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been there quite recently, have you
not, Mr. Selden?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; he answered, guessing instinctively
where she meant. &#8220;Only a couple of months ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are the people happy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, in a way. Of course life is very hard
among those bleak mountains. But then it has always
been. They are used to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is more hard than ever now, is it not?&#8221; put in
the baron, from across the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is harder than ever all over Europe,&#8221; said
Selden. &#8220;This generation will never know the old
ease.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is true,&#8221; agreed the baron; &#8220;yet, with
proper guidance, some nations will emerge more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
quickly than others. What our little country needs
is, first of all, a firm and experienced hand at the
helm, and, secondly, capital to revive its industries,
repeople its pastures and fertilize its fields. With
those, it will be the first nation in Europe to find its
feet again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly,&#8221; said Selden; &#8220;but where is the
capital to come from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really think he is right?&#8221; asked Myra
Davis, in a low voice.</p>

<p>Selden was conscious that the eyes of the whole
table were on them, and that the whole table was
waiting for his answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I really believe so,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that the people would be happier?&#8221; she persisted.</p>

<p>Then he understood. Here at least was one of
the forces urging her forward. But it would take
millions&mdash;she should understand that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said slowly, with a strange sense of responsibility.
&#8220;They would be stronger, perhaps, if
compelled to work out their own destinies. But not
happier. Certainly they would be glad to have the
way cleared for them. But to do it effectively would
take a large sum&mdash;a very large sum&mdash;many millions.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no secret about it any longer&mdash;they
were all sitting there waiting for her decision.</p>

<p>&#8220;And, mademoiselle,&#8221; pursued the baron, &#8220;our little
kingdom would be like home to you; since you
have already lived so long among our people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden looked the question he scarcely felt at
liberty to utter.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>&#8220;Nearly all of our people who went to America
settled in one place,&#8221; explained the baron, &#8220;in the
town founded by the father of mademoiselle and
named after him. There they assisted the development
of an enormous property&mdash;a mountain of copper.&#8221;</p>

<p>A great light burst upon Selden. So it was that
Davis&mdash;the copper king! Well, there would be millions
enough!</p>

<p>But those were the people who had come back
from America to make their own country a republic
also&mdash;Jeneski had told him the story; it was their
labour which had amassed those millions which were
to be used to rivet back upon them the chains they
had broken! He did not know whether to laugh or
weep at the savage irony of it!</p>

<p>The king had bent over toward Mrs. Davis and
asked her a swift question, his face purple with excitement;
she had glanced toward her daughter and
a long look had passed between them. Selden could
see the baron&#8217;s mesmeric gaze upon the girl. She
looked down, she looked up; then her cheeks went
crimson, and she nodded her head.</p>

<p>The king, with beaming face, signed to the attendants
to fill the glasses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mesdames et messieurs,&#8221; he said, rising, glass in
hand, &#8220;I have in my life, which has been a long one,
had many happy moments, but none so happy as this,
when it is my privilege to announce the betrothal
of my grandson and successor, Prince Danilo, and
the fair young lady who sits beside him. Let us
drink to their happiness and to that of my beloved
country!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>He drained his glass, sent it crashing over his
shoulder, trundled around the table, caught the girl
in his arms, and kissed her resoundingly upon each
cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the young rascal shall make
you happy&mdash;I promise it. Otherwise, I will disinherit
him, and you shall reign alone!&#8221;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI<br />


SELDEN MAKES HIS CHOICE</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was difficult to quiet down, after that, and go
on with the dinner.</p>

<p>The whole house was buzzing with the great
news, and Selden was sure that champagne was being
consumed even more liberally below stairs than
above. Probably the king knew it too, but for once
he did not care. Looking at him sitting there triumphant
and benignant, Selden was reminded of nothing
so much as of some Biblical patriarch&mdash;Abraham,
perhaps. Certainly at this moment the king&#8217;s
bosom seemed wide enough to contain the whole
world. He was ready to forgive all his enemies!</p>

<p>The baron fairly scintillated, for this was his
great hour of triumph. Even the dark, immobile
face of the Princess Anna was illumined as by some
inward light. She had come around the table and
kissed the bride-to-be solemnly on the forehead, as
though consecrating her to a sacred cause.</p>

<p>Mrs. Davis was radiant, and more inarticulate
than ever&mdash;which was of small importance since nobody
listened to her. Here was the greatest marriage
which any American family had ever achieved:
there had been dukes and counts, perhaps an earl or
two, and in one case the brother of a king (also deposed);
but never before a Crown Prince. Her
daughter would be the first American girl to sit upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
a throne! No wonder she was overcome, a little
hysterical, very warm with excitement and champagne,
dabbing her eyes now and then and looking
altogether ridiculous. She had never really believed
it would happen&mdash;Myra was such a strange girl;
yet here it was. And she had a vision of Myra sitting
on her throne, with an ermine robe and crown
of diamonds, very regal, and she herself, considerably
thinner than in life, standing a little to one side
but very near, also with ermine and brilliants; and
diplomats and statesmen in white satin knee breeches
coming up to be presented, as she had seen them in
a picture of one of Queen Victoria&#8217;s receptions, and
the crowd bowing, very happy and loyal....</p>

<p>The Countess R&eacute;mond was also deeply moved,
though in a dark and threatening way that puzzled
Selden. Her eyes were gleaming exultantly, her lips
were drawn back in a smile that was almost a snarl,
as she bent her gaze upon Myra Davis, and a spasm
of nervous emotion ran across her face from time to
time, in spite of her efforts to repress it. There
was something bloodthirsty and wolf-like about her,
which gave Selden a little shiver of repulsion, for he
felt that he was looking at the real woman, with all
her veils torn aside, and it seemed almost indecent.
She had the veils up in a moment, and was again the
calm and smiling woman of the world, but Selden
never forgot the shock of that moment&#8217;s revelation,
and any feeling of tenderness he may have had for
her died then and there. He felt only that she was
a woman to be watched and to be feared.</p>

<p>Young Davis had gone suddenly morose, but that
may have been because of his high alcoholic content;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
and the look he bent upon his sister had something
ironic and mocking in it, as though he alone understood
her, and found her far from admirable. Few
girls, however, are altogether admirable to their
brothers!</p>

<p>Of the whole company, the affianced pair were by
far the most composed. The prince had, indeed,
kissed the girl&#8217;s hand at the end of the king&#8217;s speech,
but his demonstration had ended there. As for
Myra Davis, except that her eyes were larger and
darker than usual, there was no outward evidence
that she was in any way excited. Selden wondered
where she had gained such self-control.</p>

<p>The dinner came to an end, at last, the bride-to-be
was carried away by the other women, Danilo bowing
over her hand at the door, and the men were left
together to discuss the great event.</p>

<p>It was the king who opened the discussion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust that you are pleased, M. Selden,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I was hoping that the announcement might be made
to-night, but I was not sure. I am very happy that
you were present.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I am not mistaken,&#8221; put in the baron, &#8220;M.
Selden himself had something to do with bringing
about the decision.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps so,&#8221; said Selden. &#8220;I had no suspicion
what it was leading to, but I only said what I
thought.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said it admirably,&#8221; commented the baron.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I confess,&#8221; Selden continued, &#8220;that I am astonished
you should care so much for my opinion.
After all, what does it matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>The baron glanced at the king, who nodded.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>&#8220;I have been expecting that question,&#8221; said the
baron, &#8220;and I am going to answer it frankly. We
have nothing to conceal, therefore let us place all
the cards on the table. It is, then, not yet entirely
clear ahead. To restore the dynasty&mdash;yes, that will
not be difficult. But to win the approval of the public
opinion of the world, that will not be so easy.
This is a day when republics, however inefficient, are
in favour, and when kings, however enlightened, are
looked at askance. There was a time when public
opinion outside of one&#8217;s own country could be disregarded,
but that is so no longer. There is the League
of Nations, to which Jeneski sends a delegate; there
is the Supreme Council, claiming wide powers as the
organ of public opinion. We have witnessed recently
the spectacle of a king called back to his country
by a majority of his people, and yet likely at any
time to lose his throne a second time because the
public opinion of the world is against him, and no
important country will recognize him. We wish to
avoid that mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden nodded; it was his own opinion that Constantine
would find it very difficult to cling to his
throne.</p>

<p>&#8220;That our country will be vastly benefited by this
restoration I do not for a moment doubt,&#8221; went on
the baron. &#8220;You have yourself perceived how deeply
this great opportunity appeals to Miss Davis.
Nevertheless, we shall have to maintain our position
at first against great prejudice. It will be said at
once that we have bought our way back to power,
our enemies will dig up old scandals and invent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
new ones; there will be a bitter campaign against
us. Well, we want you on our side. Wait,&#8221;
he added, as Selden made a gesture of negation;
&#8220;hear me out. What we are asking you to do is this:
to observe us, to question us, to dissect our motives,
and to report faithfully what you see and learn; to
be present at the restoration and to examine our
conduct. We do not fear public opinion, monsieur,
if it is correctly informed. I am sure that we may
count upon you to do so much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; said Selden; &#8220;of course I shall be
glad to do that&mdash;I should have done that anyway&mdash;only....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only you must be free to say what you wish&mdash;but
certainly! What we hope is to convince you,
and through you the world&mdash;especially England and
America. America will have a deep interest in this
restoration; there has never before been an American
queen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have a convention that they are all queens!&#8221;
laughed Selden. &#8220;But of course there will be tremendous
interest in a real one. May I begin asking
questions at once?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please ask as many as you wish!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you propose to accomplish this restoration?
Not by force, I hope?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not! We shall first approach Jeneski
and his ministers, lay before them our plans for the
country, and invite them to withdraw. I am
hoping that they will do so. After all, Jeneski is a
patriot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But should they still foolishly persist?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>&#8220;The Assembly is to be elected in March. We
will carry the elections and the new Assembly will
recall the king.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will bribe the electors?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all. We will explain to them, as we did
to Jeneski and his ministers, our plans for the development
and enrichment of the country; we will
organize our friends and spend some money in
propaganda&mdash;yes. But that is legitimate&mdash;even in
America, I understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Selden; &#8220;nobody can object to that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not forget, M. Selden, as I have already
pointed out to you, that the king is very popular
with his people. He could have appealed to them
before this with every hope of success; but before
he did so, he wished to be in position to assure their
future.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are sure that Miss Davis will wish to use
her millions in this way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, yes&mdash;have you not yourself seen it? She is
on fire at the great opportunity&mdash;such as comes to
very few women. And there is a certain justice, it
seems to me, in the fact that the millions wrung from
that mountain of copper by the labour of our young
men are to be used for the succour and rejuvenation
of their country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is one way of regarding it, certainly,&#8221; Selden
conceded. He glanced at young Davis, who,
more morose than ever, was tracing patterns with his
glass on the cloth. Had he no interest in his
sister&#8217;s future? Well, there was one question which
must be asked, and he himself would ask it. &#8220;What
about Miss Davis herself&mdash;her happiness, her well-being?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
Is she going to be just a tool in your hands?&#8221;</p>

<p>Davis looked up, his eyes a little bloodshot, an
ironical smile upon his lips, as though wondering
how Selden could be so silly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you for that question, sir,&#8221; put in the
king, with the utmost earnestness. &#8220;As for Miss
Davis, I charge myself with her. She shall be my
daughter. Have no fear. I was entirely serious in
what I said just now about the succession. I shall
have the necessary papers executed and passed by
the Assembly so that, in case of my death, my wishes
can be carried out if there is need.&#8221;</p>

<p>Danilo shrugged his shoulders. After all, he
seemed to say, there were many places in the world
more amusing than his bleak little capital. And
there was Madame Ghita....</p>

<p>The king regarded him sombrely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Young people to-day are lacking in reverence,&#8221;
he said, speaking in French. &#8220;They have no sense
of responsibility. It was not so in my time. I had
only nineteen years when my uncle died&mdash;Danilo,
after whom this young man is named&mdash;and I was
proclaimed Prince. It was not until fifty years later
that the Powers accorded me the title of King. During
all that time I had laboured ceaselessly; I had
driven pestilence and famine from my country; I
had organized an army and defeated the Turk; I
had founded a system of education, which still remains
the best in the Balkans; I had granted my
people a Constitution and an Assembly, and was
leading them along the path of self-government.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the war came and without hesitation I
chose the side of the Entente against the Turk and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
the Prussian. My little country was seized and overrun,
my army was captured, everything seemed lost;
but in my exile I waited patiently, certain that my
allies would win and would restore me to my throne.
That would seem to be simple justice, would it not,
monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden nodded. Undoubtedly there was a good
deal to be said on the king&#8217;s side&mdash;and the king was
an excellent advocate!</p>

<p>&#8220;I was aware,&#8221; went on the king with dignity,
&#8220;that certain old enemies of mine were seeking to
defame me, but I despised them. It is true that my
eldest son had married a German woman, but that
was nearly forty years ago. It is true that another
son took refuge in Vienna and fought with the Austrians,
but it was not with my consent&mdash;there was
nothing I could do. It is a lie that my army surrendered
unnecessarily; it was on the verge of starvation.
It is a lie that I intrigued against my allies.
Nevertheless there were some who believed these
lies.&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes were flashing and he was pounding the
table with his fist.</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened, sir, at the end?&#8221; Selden asked.
&#8220;I have heard many stories&mdash;I should like to know
the true one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you shall, sir,&#8221; said the king. &#8220;I want the
world to know it. This is what happened: When we
entered the war, some hundreds of our people who
had lived in America returned to fight for their
country. That was their duty. Nevertheless I
salute them for coming back! Many had gone to
America because they had some grievance against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
me&mdash;it is impossible to please every one!&mdash;and over
there those grievances had magnified. Also some of
our young men had gone to Vienna or to Belgrade
to study and had brought back with them ideas so
dangerous that we were compelled to forbid them
the country. These also for the most part had gone
to America, and among them there had grown up a
sentiment of revolution. They even sent back, from
time to time, an emissary to assassinate me. I did
not mind that,&#8221; the king added with a smile. &#8220;It
rendered life less dull. But it enraged my people.&#8221;</p>

<p>The baron nodded solemnly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There were two attempts,&#8221; he said; &#8220;it was not
a thing to jest about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well,&#8221; said the king, with a wave of his hand,
&#8220;all that was long ago! But these men came back.
We could not inquire then as to their sentiments;
the times were desperate&mdash;we had need of all of
them. But they brought their ideas into the army,
and, after the surrender, during the long months in
the prison camps of Austria, they had the opportunity
to propagate their poison. It spread everywhere.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then came the end. Austria withdrew her
troops for a last stand against Italy; was defeated
and surrendered. I was already back in my capital,
with Lappo here, striving to restore order, when the
prison camps were opened and the army came
streaming back. Jeneski, who had been waiting for
that moment, met them at the frontier, called together
a number of his partisans, declared for a
republic, and marched against me. I had no forces
to oppose him, and again was driven into exile. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
spite of my representations, he persuaded the conference
at Paris to confirm this so-called republic.
But he was ill at ease; he knew that I had still some
power; and he offered me a huge sum if I would
abdicate. I refused. A king cannot abdicate. Only
cowards abdicate. And I would not further impoverish
my country. No, monsieur, I am still
king!&#8221;</p>

<p>Majesty&mdash;it was a word befitting that memorable
figure, which had been buffeted by the storms of
eighty years and was still unconquered. There was
something epic about it&mdash;Homeric&mdash;so that one
forgot its follies and its sins, and remembered only
its gallantry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and my grandson shall be king after me,&#8221;
he went on, with an irate eye upon Danilo; &#8220;and
after him my great-grandson. Whether they reign
or not, that is in the hands of providence; but they
shall be kings none the less. For kingship is not a
thing that one can lay down at will; it is something
that one is born, as one is born a man. It is one&#8217;s
blood.&#8221;</p>

<p>A certain anxiety might have been discerned in
the attentive Lappo&#8217;s eye. He knew his king&mdash;he
knew the smallest corner of his mind&mdash;and he feared
perhaps that he might become too expansive with the
warmth of the wine&mdash;might go on to Divine Right
and heaven-sent prerogative. At any rate he coughed
rather markedly.</p>

<p>And the king, who also knew his Lappo, understood.
He emptied his glass and rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is time we joined the ladies,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;One moment, sir,&#8221; interjected Selden. &#8220;I realize<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
that I am a guest here to-night; I appreciate very
deeply the confidence you have shown me and the
candour with which you have spoken. I ask you,
therefore, how much of this you would wish me to
use.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, all of it, my friend!&#8221; cried the king. &#8220;How
little you understand me! All of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; said Selden, and glanced at
his watch. &#8220;In that case, I must be making my
adieux.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said the king; &#8220;but I count upon seeing
you soon again. You wish to speak to me?&#8221; he
added to Danilo, for the prince, who had grown
more and more distrait during this apologia, had
risen and come close to his side.</p>

<p>He spoke for a moment earnestly in the king&#8217;s
ear, and again Selden saw overspreading the royal
features the same cloud he had noticed once before
that evening. Nevertheless the king listened patiently
until the prince had finished, then, with an
impatient shake of the head, waved him away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, messieurs,&#8221; he said, and led the way into
the salon.</p>

<p>There was an ugly look in the prince&#8217;s eyes&mdash;the
baron stepped to his side and fell behind with him,
talking earnestly....</p>

<p>The ladies were seated before a wood fire crackling
pleasantly on a wide hearth, and it was at once
evident that the Countess R&eacute;mond was not only the
centre of the scene, but completely dominated it.
Mrs. Davis and her daughter sat close on either side
of her, and the Princess Anna, her dark face unusually
animated, bent above an embroidery-frame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
near by. And they were talking very, very confidentially.</p>

<p>The king paused for an instant on the threshold
to contemplate this picture, so delightful and domestic,
and then, as its occupants started to their feet,
came forward with a benignant smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, do not rise,&#8221; he said, and himself sat
down in a great chair which had been placed for him
at a corner of the fireplace. &#8220;How many old scenes
this brings back to me&mdash;evenings of long ago&mdash;you
remember, Anna?&mdash;when we sat together around the
fire, my family and I. We were very much out of
the world, you understand, mesdames, there in that
bleak corner of the earth, but at least we could have
books and the critiques from Paris and our own
lessons in the languages. I even wrote a poem
now and then; yes, and a play, which was pronounced
not too bad&mdash;celebrating one or another of our great
patriots and martyrs. For even a small people, M.
Selden, may have its great legends! Which reminds
me that I must not detain you. M. Selden,&#8221; he
added to the company, &#8220;goes to announce to the
world the memorable event which has taken place
here to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden&#8217;s eyes were on Myra Davis. He knew
she would look at him and he wanted to see that
look. But when it came it told him nothing. Already,
it appeared, she was learning to wear the
mask which all queens must wear!</p>

<p>So he made his adieux quickly. Only, when he
came to the countess, she held his hand close for an
instant and give him a long look, as though seeking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
to read his mind; but he was sure that she had not
succeeded.</p>

<p>The baron, detaching himself from the prince, accompanied
him to the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not see you for a few days,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It
is necessary that I go to Paris at once to arrange
certain matters. As soon as I return, I will let you
know. I shall then be able to tell you more about
our plans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are giving me a great scoop,&#8221; Selden pointed
out; &#8220;an exclusive piece of news,&#8221; he added, as the
baron stared. &#8220;If you wish that I should share it
with others....&#8221;</p>

<p>The baron stopped him with a gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, no,&#8221; he protested. &#8220;We wish it to be
yours only; we shall be very happy if you can win
some glory out of it. It will make certain chancelleries
sit up, hein? this news? Shall I call a car for
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; said Selden; &#8220;I prefer to walk,&#8221;
and left him chuckling on the steps.</p>

<p>The great gates were clanged open for him and
he passed through into the Promenade des Anglais.
The night was soft and warm, with the rising moon
painting a path of silver across the sea, and all the
world was out to drink its beauty. He would have to
go to the main postoffice to get his wire off promptly,
and he walked on as rapidly as the crowd permitted.</p>

<p>Yes, the baron was right; this news would upset
some of the chancelleries, especially those of other
little republics, delicately balanced, not yet sure of
existence. How would Jeneski take it? Time had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
not been able to dim the impression left upon him
by that vivid enthusiast&mdash;a dreamer, if there ever
was one, with a haunted look, as of a man with
something gnawing at his heart; yet not entirely a
dreamer&mdash;capable, at least, of turning into a man of
action when some desperate crisis demanded it, and
of giving and taking hard knocks. That hasty meeting
at the frontier, that declaration of a republic&mdash;he
had been a man of action then, and might be
again!</p>

<p>Yet, even as he talked with him, Jeneski had
seemed too much of another world, and that impression
was deepened now. Jeneski&#8217;s visions were all
of toil and conflict, of scaling the heights in search
of human brotherhood; but very few people cared
to scale heights. By far the most of them preferred
to sit quietly at home, before a good fire, with hands
folded complacently over a full belly. And that was
precisely what the king would offer.</p>

<p>Should he, Selden, help or hinder?</p>

<p>It was too much, perhaps, to say that he could
stop it; but the king was right in thinking that no
dynasty could now endure unless the public opinion
of the world approved. It would be easy to win that
approval, there was so much to be said on the king&#8217;s
side. It was only necessary to take him seriously.</p>

<p>And yet he was also singularly open to satire and
to irony, as the Viennese had perceived when they
built their comic operas about him. He could be
painted&mdash;and perhaps with equal justice!&mdash;either as
the patriotic and devoted father of his people, or as
a senile survival of the Middle Ages, with a degenerate
grandson for his heir.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>There was the weak spot in his armour&mdash;his
Achilles&#8217; heel; Danilo, with his amours&mdash;with Madame
Ghita....</p>

<p>But, after all, as the king had said, Danilo could
be swept aside&mdash;would be swept aside, if necessary.
He had the king&#8217;s word.</p>

<p>Why not, for the present at least, give the king
the benefit of the doubt?</p>

<p>And, this point decided, Selden felt his special
falling into shape in his brain, so that, when he
reached the telegraph office, showed his credentials,
and drew the first form from the box, it was ready
to his pen.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, with a sigh of relief and satisfaction,
he pushed the last sheet in to the impressed
attendant, and started to put away his pen. Then,
with a little smile, he drew out another form and
wrote a hasty message.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will pay for this one,&#8221; he said, and waited
until the attendant counted the words.</p>

<p>&#8220;This name, monsieur,&#8221; suggested the attendant,
&#8220;perhaps you would better spell it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;J-e-n-e-s-k-i,&#8221; said Selden; &#8220;Jeneski.&#8221;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII<br />


A DAY&#8217;S WORK</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WELL, it was done, Selden reflected rather
grimly next morning, over his coffee.</p>

<p>A telegram from the foreign editor of
the <i>Times</i> had been brought him with his breakfast
congratulating him warmly on his exclusive story
and praying him to follow it up.</p>

<p>The <i>Times</i>, for all its drum-and-trumpet democracy,
was, as he knew quite well, aristocratic and
capitalistic at heart, and so was its American namesake
with which his services were shared&mdash;indeed the
latter journal made no especial effort to conceal
the fact&mdash;and so the kind of stuff he had sent
in the night before was exceptionally welcome. It
was a sort of oasis in the desert. Presently there
would be a ponderous editorial to the effect that
staunch and sturdy Britain, with its traditional love
of sportsmanship and fair play, was prepared to
give even kings a chance!</p>

<p>Nevertheless he realized that his judgment had
been considerably clouded the night before. Doubtless
on his own quarterdeck, even Captain Kidd
might seem a picturesque and downright character,
who could cite injustices done him, and could point
to atrocities committed by civilized society far more
horrible than any of his own; he might even attain
a certain merit because of his bold directness, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
straight speaking, his scorn of littleness. He was
probably fond of children and a sentimentalist at
bottom.</p>

<p>So the king face to face was more impressive than
in retrospect; yet, Selden reminded himself, there
was a lot to be said for him. The trouble was that
there was so little to be said for his grandson.</p>

<p>Though, Selden added to himself, even here he
might be unjust. He did not really know Danilo.
One thing in his favour was that he did not pose&mdash;people
could take him or leave him. He was not a
coward, and undoubtedly he had his code. Many
crown princes had sown abundant wild oats, and yet
made excellent kings.</p>

<p>But Selden knew it was none of these things that
really troubled him; it was the uneasy feeling that he
had been responsible for that quick nod of the head
which Myra Davis had given her mother. And
that, he told himself, was something he could <i>not</i> be
responsible for&mdash;not, at least, until he was sure she
understood exactly everything that nod let her in
for. After that, if she wished to keep on nodding,
it would be nobody&#8217;s affair but her own.</p>

<p>Therefore it was his duty to see that she did understand.
He must go to her and tell her&mdash;tell her
very plainly and directly, without palliating phrases.
He squirmed a little at the prospect, but there was
no other way he could square himself with his conscience.
She would probably resent it, and her
mother of course would be vastly outraged. But he
must risk it.</p>

<p>He had the feeling that the baron had been a little
lacking in candour the night before; his opinions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
had been asked without any hint of their implications.
Yet, as he cast his mind back over what he
had said, he did not see where he would have altered
it, even if he had known. Nevertheless it was up
to him to enlighten Miss Davis very thoroughly on
the morals and manners of princes.</p>

<p>He was staring moodily out of the window, turning
all this over in his mind, and keeping resolutely
submerged a very, very sore spot in his consciousness
whose existence he would not even admit, when
a knock at the door announced a boy with a salver,
on which lay a tiny note.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will be on the terrace at eleven,&#8221; it said, and
it was signed &#8220;Vera de R&eacute;mond.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no answer,&#8221; he said to the boy, tipped
him, and went back to the window. What did he
care where the countess would be at eleven!
He had not forgotten that moment of revelation the
night before when she had looked at Myra Davis
like a beast of prey sure of its quarry. There had
been in her face a kind of gloating, as though she
were revenging herself in some way upon the girl.
But that was nonsense. Yet why had she seemed
so triumphant? Could the quarry be some one else&mdash;Jeneski,
Madame Ghita?</p>

<p>The name was uttered at last; he had not been
able to keep it back. Yes, there was the sore spot;
it was for her he was uneasy, it was she for whom his
heart reproached him, it was she whom he wished to
protect....</p>

<p>He suddenly made up his mind that he would see
the countess. If she really had a secret, he would
drag it out of her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>So he arrayed himself rapidly, glad to have something
definite to do, and sallied forth into the bright,
cool morning.</p>

<p>He had not noticed the time, but as he left the
hotel, the big clock over the casino entrance told him
that he was early, so he strolled about the camembert,
as the little round park just in front of the
casino is derisively called, and looked at the people
and tried to arrange his thoughts.</p>

<p>The crowd here is astonishingly different from that
on the terrace, for these are the people who haunt
the public rooms&mdash;derelicts, for the most part,
poised as it were before the mouth of the dragon,
searching for an inspiration before plunging in to
stake their last louis; or perhaps with their last louis
lost and nothing to do but watch the feverish procession
which continually ascends and descends the
casino steps, and wonder where another louis could
be borrowed or begged or stolen.</p>

<p>It is a motley and sordid crowd, lolling on the
benches or loitering uncertainly about: ridiculous old
women, wonderfully arrayed in the fabrics of 1860,
fondly misinterpreting the astonished glances cast at
them; frizzled old men struggling to conceal a bankrupt
interior behind a pompous front; cocottes endeavouring
to pretend they are not for everybody
and at the same time to appear not too difficult; impecunious
gamblers trying to pose as men of affairs,
but always betrayed by a loose end somewhere;
dowdy old couples to whom the tables have become a
habit more devastating than any drug&mdash;a new
Com&eacute;die Humaine waiting for another Balzac.</p>

<p>Selden, regarding these people for the hundredth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
time with an appreciative eye, wished that he were
the Balzac, and sighing a little because he was not,
he turned away to the gayer life of the terrace&mdash;gayer
at least on the surface, fascinating as a whirlpool
is fascinating, tempting the onlooker to jump
in and be swallowed up, and seductive, as things
dangerous and forbidden have been seductive since
the days of Eve.</p>

<p>The Countess R&eacute;mond possessed those qualities
of fascination and intrigue, too&mdash;superlatively. He
realized it anew as he saw her coming toward him
down the steps, her lithe uncorseted body faultlessly
clad in a grey tailleur, which, conventional and
subdued as it was, seemed somehow exotic as she
wore it. Selden thanked his stars that he had gained
immunity the night before by that glimpse he had
had of her soul; it was very pleasant to know himself
out of danger.</p>

<p>&#8220;How good of you to come,&#8221; she said, as he took
her hand. And then she looked at him more closely,
for her instinct felt the change in him. &#8220;Are you
annoyed at something? Did it disarrange you to
meet me here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; not at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall keep you but a moment. But I felt that
I must have a little talk with you before....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Before....&#8221; he prompted, as she hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before I begin my day&#8217;s work. And since the
safest place for a confidential conversation is in the
midst of a crowd....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So we are going to have a confidential conversation?&#8221;
queried Selden, falling into step beside
her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>&#8220;Yes; on my part, at least. Like the baron, I am
going to place all my cards on the table.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is what I had been hoping,&#8221; said Selden,
quietly.</p>

<p>She looked at him quickly, smiling a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I saw in your eyes last night that you were
not pleased with me. Perhaps I had had too much
champagne. But I am quite recovered from that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; said Selden, grimly. &#8220;In fact, I am
very sober&mdash;I have even some twinges of remorse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was afraid you would have. That is one reason
I wanted to see you. We must talk it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we must,&#8221; he assented.</p>

<p>She led the way to a seat at the end of the terrace
facing the harbour, where they could talk undisturbed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; she said, &#8220;why remorse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; began Selden slowly, &#8220;you know as well
as I do that, while this flood of American money
may be a sort of short-cut to prosperity for your
little country, in the end it will be disastrous for it,
since it brings the old dynasty back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I know nothing of the sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long do you think the old king has to live?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, not long. He has already had two heart
attacks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I see what you mean,&#8221; he murmured; &#8220;and
after him the republic again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. My country would never endure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
Danilo, nor permit itself to be governed by an American.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But in that case,&#8221; he pointed out, &#8220;this whole affair
is nothing but a piece of sharp practice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Against whom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Against the Davises.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said negligently; &#8220;they deserve it. I
am not concerned about them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I am,&#8221; he said. &#8220;At least I am concerned
for Miss Davis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You need not be,&#8221; she assured him, with a flash
of the eyes. &#8220;She is by no means the ing&eacute;nue you
seem to suppose; she can take care of herself. And
she can afford to lose a few millions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t the money&mdash;I think the country should
have some of it; but she ought to know exactly what
she is letting herself in for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean Madame Ghita?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, why do you not tell her?&#8221; she asked mockingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve about made up my mind that I shall have
to,&#8221; he said dismally. &#8220;You see I sort of pushed her
into it last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was smiling again as she looked at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;And this is the real cause of the remorse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you push her into it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was silly enough to say that I really thought
she could do a lot of good out there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;do you not believe it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I believe it. But that isn&#8217;t the question.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
Dash it all, you know as well as I do what I
mean. These women are absolutely ignorant of
European ideas&mdash;of the ideas of such fellows as
Danilo. Mrs. Davis poses as worldly-wise, thoroughly
initiated, but she is really as ignorant as a
child. She has heard that men have mistresses, that
husbands are sometimes unfaithful, and so has her
daughter, I suppose. But it is all outside their personal
experience. It is always some other woman&#8217;s
husband. It would never occur to either of them
that their own husbands could be, or that in this particular
instance the husband-to-be is not only unfaithful
now, but hasn&#8217;t the slightest intention of being
faithful in the future&mdash;that he would laugh at such
an idea&mdash;that at this moment he is living here with
his mistress....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she is not his mistress,&#8221; put in the countess
quietly.</p>

<p>Selden, halted in mid-career, could only stare. A
dozen conjectures flashed through his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not his mistress?&#8221; he stammered.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is Madame Ghita you are talking about, I
suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is his wife&mdash;she has a right to the name; I
have even the idea that he is faithful to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His wife!&#8221; Selden gasped. &#8220;But....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Married quite regularly in Paris&mdash;morganatically,
of course. I do not know whether you will
think that better or worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden, his head in a whirl, did not know himself.
But of one thing he was sure&mdash;the wrong to Madame
Ghita would be far worse than he had fancied.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
He tried to explain this to the countess, who listened
with an amused smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;You remind me of those silly old knights,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;who were always riding out to rescue some
damsel, without waiting to find out whether she
really wanted to be rescued. Don&#8217;t worry about
Madame Ghita. In the first place, she knew perfectly
well when she married the prince that he would
have to marry again some day for the sake of the
dynasty. In the second place, I suspect that the
prince is much more in love with her than she is with
him. At least, the baron tells me that she is an
unusually clever woman, while, as you know, the
prince is quite stupid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So she can hold him if she wants to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly. And if she wants to, she will stop
at nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know her?&#8221; Selden asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you don&#8217;t know....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whether she will want to? No&mdash;but I am going
to find out. I have asked her to lunch with me
to-day. That is the first part of my day&#8217;s
work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does Miss Davis know about her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet&mdash;at least, I do not think so. But she is
going to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean you are going to tell her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the countess, with a little grimace.
&#8220;That is the second part of my day&#8217;s work. I have
tea with her and her mother this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden took off his hat and drew a deep breath of
relief.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>&#8220;Then that lets me out,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s
rather sporting of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not idealize me nor my motives,&#8221; protested
the countess. &#8220;It is a matter of business. Lappo
asked me to. We are going to tell her because she
is certain now to learn it anyway, and it is far better
that she learn it from us than from some malicious
newspaper or anonymous letter. It will not be difficult;
as the baron puts it, it will be almost as though
she were marrying a divorced man. That will not
shock her so much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I suppose not,&#8221; Selden agreed. &#8220;Of course
you will swing it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I think so,&#8221; agreed the countess with a little
smile. &#8220;But before I started to try to swing it, I
wanted to have this talk with you, so that everything
would be quite clear between us. I must know where
you stand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. Cards on the table. Go ahead,&#8221; and
he settled back to listen.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Miss Davis has the situation explained to her,
so that she knows what she is letting herself in for,
as you put it, and still chooses to go ahead with it,
you will have no further compunctions on that score,
I hope?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the countess quietly, &#8220;I shall be very
much surprised if she does not go on with it. She is
neither a child nor a fool&mdash;and there is a compelling
impulse driving her on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;she sees herself the benefactress of an impoverished
people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The country will have a new saint!&#8221; said the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
countess with a mocking little laugh. &#8220;But perhaps
there is still another reason.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think the prince attracts her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no&mdash;though she may get to like him. At
present, he is just a necessary evil, since for children
there must be a father! He has one quality which
will appeal to her more and more&mdash;he knows how
to be discreet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which reminds me,&#8221; Selden remarked, &#8220;that the
explosion you expected last night did not take place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;the prince prevented it. It was that made
him late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was with her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He must have promised her something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She knows, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. Lappo has already had a talk with
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did she say to him?&#8221;</p>

<p>The countess smiled at remembrance of the baron&#8217;s
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know exactly&mdash;except that she spoke of
love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you see!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that does not discourage me,&#8221; went on the
countess cheerfully. &#8220;On the contrary. Women
really in love rarely speak of it. My own impression
is that she is determined to make the best bargain
she can&mdash;and she is right. But I shall have it out
with her at lunch&mdash;that is, if she comes. She has
not yet accepted, but I think she will, if only out of
curiosity. There may be some fireworks, but in the
end she will agree. I am sure of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Agree to what?&#8221; asked Selden.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>&#8220;Agree to exchange the prince for the annuity
which the king is now, for the first time, able to offer
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden made a grimace of distaste. All this was a
little too cynical&mdash;especially as it touched Madame
Ghita.</p>

<p>The countess looked at him, her eyes sparkling
with amusement, not entirely free from malice.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not like it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if she <i>does</i> agree, you will have no compunctions
about her either?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;if she really does.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not believe she will?&#8221; she asked, looking
at him with a gaze suddenly intent, as though for the
first time she saw something in his face she had not
before suspected. &#8220;Well, come to lunch, too, and
see for yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden stared.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is <i>my</i> lunch,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;I may ask whom
I please. You will enjoy it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure of that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides, I shall need your moral support,&#8221; she
added, laughingly. &#8220;Please come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will Lappo be there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;he has gone to Paris to arrange the marriage
settlement with the Davis solicitor. There
will be just us three. If she does not come, we shall
be t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden was distinctly conscious that he had no
ardour for a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with the Countess R&eacute;mond,
and, though he did his best to keep it out of his face,
she instantly perceived it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>&#8220;How American you are!&#8221; she said, looking at
him with laughing eyes. &#8220;No; I am not offended.
But do not be afraid. She will come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if she resents my presence....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She will not. If she does, you can leave before
the real discussion begins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Selden, &#8220;I&#8217;ll come. But I don&#8217;t
promise to give you any moral support. You may
find me fighting on the other side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I shall be sure to win!&#8221; said the countess,
and looked at him with a strange smile. &#8220;Now I
must be going. The luncheon is at one, in my apartment.&#8221;
She glanced at her watch and sprang to her
feet in a sudden panic. &#8220;Juste ciel! I must fly!
No, you are not to come with me. I am in earnest.
Please do not!&#8221;</p>

<p>He watched her as she hurried away through the
crowd and up the steps toward the casino.</p>

<p>At the top of the steps a burly man was standing,
as though keeping an appointment, his eyes on the
entrance to the hotel just across the street. The
countess approached him swiftly and touched his
arm.</p>

<p>As he started round upon her, Selden caught a
glimpse of his face. It was Halsey, of the <i>Journal</i>.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII<br />


CLEARING THE GROUND</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHAT could be the connection between Halsey
and the Countess R&eacute;mond, Selden wondered,
as he turned away. He tried to
remember what he knew of Halsey, but it was not
very much. They had met casually in Paris a
number of times, and had dinner with him once at
the Cercle Interalli&eacute;, when they happened to be
working on the same story, but that was all.</p>

<p>He had never liked Halsey&#8217;s style. The <i>Journal</i>
was a sensational sheet; always seeking to play up
the scandalous, never so happy as when it was able
to uncover a dark corner in the life of some public
man, ever eager to impute unworthy motives to the
backers of any cause&mdash;and Halsey rather gave the
impression that he liked that sort of thing. Certainly
he was not held in very high esteem by his
associates, and Selden&#8217;s own idea was that he had
lived so long in a cynical circle in Paris that he had
caught its tone.</p>

<p>Once he got hold of this affair of the prince and
Myra Davis, Selden very well knew what he would
make of it&mdash;more especially if he discovered the
existence of Madame Ghita. But of that he was
probably already aware, since the marriage had no
doubt been played up by him at the time it occurred.</p>

<p>He wondered if the countess, for some reason of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
her own, was keeping Halsey informed. But she
could scarcely do that, since Halsey&#8217;s jeers would
imperil the whole plan upon which her heart was
so evidently set. Or was she keeping him in order?
Or was he just her lover? But Selden could not
imagine why such a woman as the countess....</p>

<p>And then all thought of Halsey and the countess
vanished, for he saw approaching the woman whom,
from the first moment he reached the terrace, he had
hoped to see; the woman about whom his thoughts
were centring more and more; who, in the last half
hour, had taken on for him a new interest and a
new meaning.</p>

<p>She saw him at the same instant, and turned and
spoke a word to the man walking beside her, and
Selden, looking at him, perceived it was young
Davis, completely immersed in Miss Fayard, who
walked on his other side, and who was certainly not
unresponsive. In another moment Davis was bringing
the ladies toward him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Selden,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I want you to meet Madame
Ghita. You remember....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Selden; &#8220;I am happy indeed to
meet madame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I also,&#8221; she said, and gave him her hand with a
charming smile. &#8220;But let us speak French. To myself
I said, who can it be, that man so distinguished
whom I have not seen here before, and later I inquired
of M. Davis. What he told me made me
more than ever curious, so when I saw you just now,
I commanded him to present you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was very nice of you,&#8221; said Selden, making
a mental note of that word &#8220;later.&#8221; So the prince<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
and Davis had kept the appointment, as he had supposed
they would do.</p>

<p>Her eyes were resting on his with the same frank
and unembarrassed questioning he had noticed the
first time he saw her, as though she were seeking to
discover what was passing in his mind, what he was
pondering about. They were a very dark brown, those
eyes, almost black; and again he noted the ivory
softness of her skin, innocent of make-up, and singularly
glowing in spite of her lack of colour.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my niece, Mlle. Fayard,&#8221; she added, and
Selden bowed to the young girl. &#8220;You two may
walk on and continue your French lesson, while I
talk to M. Selden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is teaching me the first conjugation,&#8221; Davis
explained, looking ridiculously happy. &#8220;We have
started with <i>aimer</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Allez, allez!&#8221; commanded madame, laughing at
the blush which overspread the girl&#8217;s cheek. &#8220;With
a Frenchman I could not do that,&#8221; she added, looking
after them. &#8220;But with an American, yes. Why
is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Selden.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you agree with me that it is quite safe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said Selden; &#8220;for the girl, that is.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed outright.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you really such a cynic?&#8221; she asked. Then
she grew suddenly serious. &#8220;Do not be mistaken
about her&mdash;she is a very good girl, believe me. I
have taken good care of her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see that,&#8221; said Selden, and they walked on
for a moment in silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you married?&#8221; she asked suddenly. &#8220;Forgive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
me,&#8221; she added, as he stared a little; &#8220;but it is
something that a woman always wishes to know
about a man. I do not think you are, but I should
like to be sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not,&#8221; said Selden. &#8220;A fellow who
knocks around the world as I do has no business to
be married.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You travel a great deal?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am always looking for trouble. Whenever
there is a row anywhere, I pack my bag and start.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it for trouble you came to Monte Carlo?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; said Selden. &#8220;I came here to get warm,
after two months in the Balkans&mdash;also to rest a little.
And I have had the good fortune to meet here
some very interesting people&mdash;one superlatively so,&#8221;
and he made her a little bow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. But you have not rested?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I usually find some work to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then, of course, there are the tables.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the women.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;they are wonderful, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221; he countered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not all of them. But the one you were with
yesterday seemed to me rather unusual. Who was
she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that,&#8221; said Selden, calmly, &#8220;was the Countess
R&eacute;mond.&#8221;</p>

<p>He felt that he had scored, although Madame
Ghita certainly did not start. But there was a new
expression in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is an old friend of yours?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I met her Monday evening.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>&#8220;I have never met her,&#8221; said madame; &#8220;but I am
going to have lunch with her to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you?&#8221; said Selden. &#8220;I am very glad. So
am I.&#8221;</p>

<p>This time she did start.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are sure it is for to-day that you are asked?&#8221;
she questioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. She told me that she had invited you,
but that you had not as yet accepted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you are in the plot, too,&#8221; she said slowly,
and the eyes with which she scanned his face were
quite black. &#8220;That is a thing I had not suspected.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Selden quickly, &#8220;I am not in any
plot. But if I were, I should be on your side, madame;
I pray you to believe it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him yet a moment as though striving
to read his very inmost thought. Then she
glanced around.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us sit down,&#8221; she said, and led the way to a
bench. &#8220;Now you must tell me what you know&mdash;everything.
In the first place, you know, do you not,
that Prince Danilo is my husband?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I know that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As legally my husband as the woman you marry
will be your wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Except that I have no claim upon his estates or
his title, and our children, if we had any, could not
succeed to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And there was, of course, the understanding that
some day, if he wished, he would be free to make a
marriage of state in order to carry on the title.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the prince does not wish to marry again.
If he consents, it is only because the king commands
it, and he conceives it to be his duty to his country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can well believe it, madame,&#8221; said Selden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh bien, I went to Nice last night to stop it;
after all, I have some pride, some rights. I will not
be disregarded and cast aside like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; said Selden. &#8220;You are right.
Do you need my help?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him suddenly, with curious intentness.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are in earnest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled at him, almost tenderly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not forget that,&#8221; she said; &#8220;perhaps some
day I may even call upon you. But I did not interfere
last night because Danilo gave me his word that
he would leave the matter in my hands to decide one
way or the other, before the settlement is signed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was fine of him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Danilo is a gentleman,&#8221; said madame; &#8220;and
he will keep his word. Besides....&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped and shrugged her shoulders, but to
Selden the shrug was more eloquent than words.
She meant, of course, that Danilo loved her. And
she&mdash;did she love him? That was the question
Selden would have liked to ask, but he did not
dare.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have not yet made up your mind?&#8221; he
asked instead.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered slowly, looking at him with
a queer little smile; &#8220;you see there are so many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
things to consider. Of course, if Danilo refuses, the
king will cast him off&mdash;for a time, at least&mdash;and
there will be no more money. Danilo could never
earn any, and he has borrowed all that is possible.
So his affection for me would grow less and less day
by day&mdash;for he is like a cat; he must be comfortable;
and at last the day would come when he could endure
it no longer, and would tell me good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are saying nothing of yourself,&#8221; Selden
pointed out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I could endure it no more than he!&#8221; laughed
his companion. &#8220;Less perhaps! So it may be the
part of wisdom, for his sake and for my sake, to
make the best bargain I can, now, while there is a
chance. Does that seem very cynical?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; just sensible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But one is not supposed to be sensible in affairs
of the heart&mdash;is it not so? Well, I may not be
sensible in this affair&mdash;I cannot tell. But I am willing
to listen to what they have to say. The Countess
R&eacute;mond is an emissary from the king, is she not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And she is inviting me to lunch in order to discuss
this affair?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought so,&#8221; and again she looked at him, with
her strange little smile. &#8220;What I do not understand
is that you also should be there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, madame,&#8221; said Selden quickly, &#8220;I pointed
out to her that you would not like it. I shall not
come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I did not say I did not like it. On the contrary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
I wish you to come. Only, if you are an
ally of the countess, I must be prepared for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not an ally of the countess,&#8221; Selden protested;
&#8220;not in any sense. I should like to be your
ally, madame, if you will have me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She glanced at him quickly, then turned her head
away for a moment, as though looking for her niece
and Davis. Then she looked back at him, and her
face was very tender.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I will have you!&#8221; she said, her voice
a little thick.</p>

<p>Selden was deeply moved; he looked away, out
over the sea, and for a moment there was silence between
them&mdash;but it was a silence which said many
things.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you met her,&#8221; she asked at last, &#8220;this Miss
Davis?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does she resemble her brother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; said Selden; &#8220;not in the least. She is
much stronger and finer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You admire her then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;in a way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she fond of Danilo?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think so&mdash;not especially.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it is just ambition&mdash;ambition to be a
queen!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her mother is ambitious, and of course urges her
on. But I think what Miss Davis cares for most is
the opportunity to do good with her money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; said Madame Ghita quickly; &#8220;a man
might believe that, but not a woman! There is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
something beside that&mdash;there must be&mdash;something
more personal, more passionate. I am sure of it.
If I could only see her! Well, it may be possible&mdash;why
not? I would invite her to open her heart to
me, as I should open mine to her, and together we
would decide. Yes, yes&mdash;that would make it easy!&#8221;</p>

<p>A donkey-engine which had been unloading coal
from a steamer beside the quay gave a shrill shriek
with its whistle and abruptly stopped. There came
a tinkle of bells from the ships in the harbour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twelve o&#8217;clock!&#8221; cried Madame Ghita. &#8220;Can
it be? I must be going! Where are those children?
Come, we must look for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The children were discovered not far away, leaning
over the balustrade, watching a low Italian destroyer
which was steaming rapidly along the coast,
and working assiduously at their languages&mdash;French
for Davis, English for Cicette. They seemed to be
progressing very satisfactorily among the tenses of
&#8220;aimer&#8221;&mdash;though Cicette found it difficult to get
exactly the correct sound of the &#8220;o&#8221; in love, and
Davis thought the way she said it much prettier
than the right way&mdash;as, indeed, on her lips it was.</p>

<p>Madame Ghita broke in upon them without compunction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Cicette,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Bid adieu to the
gentlemen&mdash;we must be going. It is very late.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden, looking at her more carefully than he had
taken the trouble to do before, found her much less
ordinary than she had seemed at first glance. Her
face was yet a girl&#8217;s, but it gave promise of
character as well as beauty. Davis might well do
worse!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>&#8220;But look here,&#8221; Davis protested, &#8220;I won&#8217;t see
you again till evening, then! Why can&#8217;t I take Cicette
to lunch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible!&#8221; said madame firmly. &#8220;I have her
reputation to consider,&#8221; and she led her charge
away.</p>

<p>The two men watched them as they went up the
steps&mdash;the elder woman so straight, so graceful, so
full of ease; the younger fluttering beside her like a
butterfly, her feet scarce touching the ground. It
was difficult to realize that the actual difference in
their ages was probably not more than five or six
years, and that the impression of maturity which
Madame Ghita gave was due almost wholly to her
finish, her ease, her perfect poise. As they passed
from sight, Davis took off his hat and wiped his
forehead and breathed a deep sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it as bad as that?&#8221; inquired Selden, with a
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m in love all right,&#8221; Davis answered, &#8220;and
I&#8217;m going to marry her&mdash;I don&#8217;t give a damn what
anybody says. I&#8217;ve never met a girl who could hold
a candle to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; said Selden, &#8220;if you can get your
mind off that young woman for a minute or two, I&#8217;d
like to talk to you about something else. What
about this engagement between your sister and
Danilo?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what about it?&#8221; asked Davis, a little truculently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does she know about Madame Ghita?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&mdash;probably not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think she ought to know?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>&#8220;What for? When the prince marries again, Madame
Ghita becomes his widow, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps so,&#8221; assented Selden, scenting the
baron&#8217;s teaching. &#8220;Just the same she ought to
know there is a widow. It would be squarer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, I can tell mother,&#8221; said Davis.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think she already knows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well then, it&#8217;s none of my business,&#8221; said Davis,
impatiently. &#8220;And don&#8217;t you worry about sis; she&#8217;s
perfectly able to take care of herself, and always
has been. If you think she would take any advice
from her loving brother you&#8217;re greatly mistaken&mdash;she
looks down upon me as a kind of insect to
be pitied but not respected. Also, if she has made
up her mind to marry Danilo, she&#8217;ll marry him just
the same if she knew he had ten widows! See here,
though&mdash;I&#8217;ll tell her if you want me to, provided
you&#8217;ll do something for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Selden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Help me to get mother&#8217;s consent to marry Cicette.
I&#8217;m of age, and I can marry anybody I want
to&mdash;but dad never had much confidence in me, and
my money is all tied up so I can&#8217;t touch it. Beastly,
I call it. Of course I&#8217;d have enough to live on, but
if I married Cicette, I&#8217;d want to show her the time
of her life. Will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden looked appraisingly into the pleading face.
Perhaps Davis wasn&#8217;t such a bad sort, after all.
The right kind of wife might make a man of him.
Even a big brother might do something. Selden had
never had a kid brother, and the thought rather appealed
to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t promise,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I want to look you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
both over a bit more first&mdash;I haven&#8217;t spoken two
words to Cicette and not many more to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Davis must have seen a certain sympathy in Selden&#8217;s
eyes, for he caught his hand and wrung it delightedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;I agree. The more
you see of Cicette, the more you will like her. I&#8217;m
not afraid of that. But you&#8217;ve got to convince
mother that she&#8217;s good enough for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I wasn&#8217;t thinking of that!&#8221; Selden retorted.
&#8220;The only question in my mind is whether you are
good enough for her! Now I&#8217;ve got to go,&#8221; and he
left Davis staring after him in delighted amazement.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV<br />


PLACE AUX DAMES</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SELDEN went up to his room and got ready for
lunch with a clearer conscience than he had
had since he opened his eyes that morning. At
last he knew where he was&mdash;he was definitely aligned&mdash;not
on the king&#8217;s side, or the prince&#8217;s side, or Miss
Davis&#8217;s side, or the countess&#8217;s side, but on Madame
Ghita&#8217;s side. And there, he was quite sure, he would
remain until the end, whatever the end might be.
Whatever help he could give her was hers to command.
Not that she seemed to need any help! Just
the same, there he was, and the consciousness of
that fact might be some comfort to her.</p>

<p>And as the first step, he decided to be promptly
on time, so that Madame Ghita might find him&mdash;her
ally!&mdash;on the spot when she arrived. So, at one
o&#8217;clock precisely, he was knocking at the door of the
countess&#8217;s suite.</p>

<p>It was opened by a heavy-set woman of middle
age, Slav or Italian, discretion personified. Evidently
the countess chose her maid not for looks but
for qualities more useful, and one glance at this
woman confirmed him in the opinion that the
countess was a born intriguer.</p>

<p>She took his hat and ushered him into the salon,
where the countess joined him in a moment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>&#8220;I know you will be greatly disappointed,&#8221; she
said a little maliciously, &#8220;but it is not to be a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te,
after all. Madame Ghita is coming. You see
I was right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;and I feel like the second at a duel,&#8221; Selden
commented.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do not be alarmed,&#8221; said the countess lightly.
&#8220;There will be no bloodshed&mdash;a few feints at the
most. Then she will surrender. What else can she
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am inclined to think she can upset the whole
affair if she wants to&mdash;so don&#8217;t be too confident.
And I warn you that my sympathies are entirely on
her side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; said the countess, looking at him
with a strange little smile. &#8220;That is one reason I
wanted you here.&#8221;</p>

<p>And before he had a chance to ask her what she
meant by that, the maid ushered in Madame Ghita.</p>

<p>More than ever Selden was reminded of the field
of honour by the way the two ladies shook hands,
each measuring the other, and he breathed a sigh
of relief, for it was instantly evident that Madame
Ghita had nothing to fear from her antagonist. She
was, as always, calm, smiling, perfectly at ease, while
there was in the cheeks of the countess an unwonted
flush of colour which betrayed a profound
excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was too good of you to offer me lunch, madame,&#8221;
Madame Ghita was saying. &#8220;I have heard
so much of you from the prince, my husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>Certainly, Selden thought, the lady was losing no
time, for the last words had been flung at the feet of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
the countess like a gage of battle. But the countess
chose for the moment to disregard them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said sweetly, &#8220;I had the pleasure of
meeting Monsieur le Prince a few nights ago. Permit
me to present to you a friend of mine, M.
Selden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Enchanted,&#8221; said madame; &#8220;it is always a pleasure
to meet Americans,&#8221; and she gave Selden her
hand, her eyes shining with amusement, with a quick
little pressure of the fingers which recognized him
as an ally with a secret between them.</p>

<p>The countess had given a signal to her maid, who
drew apart the curtains before an alcove looking
down upon the public gardens and disclosed the waiting
table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; she said, and led the way to it, placing
Selden on her right and Madame Ghita on her left,
facing each other across the centre-piece of feathery
mimosa.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is delightful here,&#8221; said Madame Ghita, looking
out across the gardens as she drew off her gloves
and tucked them back out of the way. &#8220;My apartment
is on the other side, facing the south, with a
little too much sun. Here you have the sun only in
the morning. Are you staying in this hotel also, M.
Selden?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, madame,&#8221; said Selden, &#8220;and my room also
faces the south; but I do not complain, for I cannot
soak up sun enough after two months in the Balkans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been in the Balkans? I have never
been there. Strange, is it not, when one considers
that my husband is prince of a Balkan country. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
he himself has not been there for a long time&mdash;through
no fault of his,&#8221; she added with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;It appears he will be going back before long,&#8221;
remarked the countess.</p>

<p>She had nodded to the maid, who served the hors
d&#8217;&#339;uvres, taking the dishes from a table near the
outer door, where the waiters left them&mdash;a discreet
arrangement, to which she was apparently well accustomed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I have heard that Baron Lappo has another
plot in hand,&#8221; said Madame Ghita negligently, and
glanced at the maid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you can trust Anita,&#8221; said the countess
quickly, noticing the glance. &#8220;For one thing, she is
very deaf.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame Ghita laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Deafness is very convenient sometimes, is it not?
And I can see she is discreet. An old family servant,
perhaps?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has been with me for a long time,&#8221; said the
countess. &#8220;She has but one fault&mdash;a weakness for
gambling. In Paris, she wastes her last sou on the
races; here the tables take everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a terrible vice,&#8221; agreed Madame Ghita.
&#8220;Have you been having good luck, M. Selden?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, madame,&#8221; said Selden, &#8220;I have never
played seriously&mdash;I lack the gambler&#8217;s instinct.
When I am winning, I never dare to push my good
luck far enough, and when I am losing, I always stop
just too soon. I always hear my number come as I
leave the table! To my mind, the only way to play
is to sit down certain of winning&mdash;resolved to win,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
or to lose one&#8217;s last franc in the effort. But I have
not the temperament&mdash;I am too cautious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Madame Ghita, &#8220;it is so my husband
plays&mdash;and he always loses his last franc.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again it seemed to Selden that there was a trace
of defiance in the way she uttered those words&mdash;&#8220;mon
mari&#8221;&mdash;my husband. It was the third time she had
used them since she entered the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;He does not always lose, madame,&#8221; Selden corrected.
&#8220;I saw him winning the bank&#8217;s last franc a
few nights ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But by this time the bank has them all back again.
I sometimes think it is even worse for a gambler to
win than to lose. He is encouraged to go on&mdash;to
commit new follies. You should be thankful you
have not the temperament, M. Selden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you, madame?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I too gamble sometimes, it is true, not because
I have the temperament but because I have
great need to distract my thoughts. What would
you, monsieur! Here am I the wife of a prince, but
not recognized because I have no money; in a position
the most equivocal, knowing that schemes are constantly
afoot to marry him to some other woman.
Is it strange that I become a little mad sometimes
and do foolish things? I tremble myself at the
things I think of doing&mdash;plan out to the last little
detail as I lie awake at night staring at the ceiling.
I have been to him a faithful wife&mdash;I have
been discreet&mdash;I have asked nothing&mdash;I have worked
for his interest whenever I could. And what is my
reward? That fat Lappo comes to me and insults
me!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>&#8220;Surely he did not insult you, madame!&#8221; protested
the countess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it not an insult to offer a woman a price for
her love?&#8221; demanded Madame Ghita. &#8220;And such
a price!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it is only a question of price,&#8221; began the
countess.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not!&#8221; broke in Madame Ghita. &#8220;After all,
I have my pride! And I have also perhaps more
power than they think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you have always known, madame,&#8221; pointed
out the countess, &#8220;that some day the prince would
marry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said madame; &#8220;but if I wish, I will take
him away from his wife on his wedding-night, as I
did on the night of his betrothal!&#8221; and she attacked
her salade viciously. &#8220;Oh, I am not a fool,&#8221; she
went on. &#8220;I know what is planned&mdash;Danilo confides
in me. I know what occurred last night. I had
made up my mind to prevent it, but....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But your better sense prevailed,&#8221; said the countess.
&#8220;You said to yourself, since a marriage must
take place, it may as well be now as any time, more
especially since now it will give the dynasty its throne
again, while, in another six months, it will be too
late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That makes nothing to me!&#8221; sniffed Madame
Ghita.</p>

<p>&#8220;And since it will also give you an annuity,&#8221; went
on the countess, undisturbed, &#8220;on which you can live
in comfort&mdash;luxury even.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I warn you that luxury is expensive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One can live very well,&#8221; said the countess, &#8220;even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
in these days, on a hundred and fifty thousand francs
a year.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence. Selden was deeply
moved to see a tear roll slowly down Madame
Ghita&#8217;s cheek and splash into her plate. But there
was one tear only; she was herself again in a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I must understand where I
am. Is it Lappo who sent you to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; he asked me to see you, since he had failed
himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid I was not very polite to the good
Lappo,&#8221; admitted Madame Ghita, &#8220;though I am
rather fond of him. But I was annoyed that day,
and it seemed to me that he took things too much
for granted&mdash;as though I had nothing to do but to
accept whatever he was pleased to allow me. He
is in some ways a great man, and I think he even
has a certain fondness for me, but....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has told me as much,&#8221; put in the countess.</p>

<p>&#8220;But beside this old king of his, this dynasty to
which he is a slave, nothing else matters. I am certain
he would not hesitate to murder his son, to kill
his wife, if he had one, if they stood in its way. He
is a fanatic on that subject. It would be a good thing
for him if the dynasty perished. There is another
thing I do not understand,&#8221; she went on, more
calmly. &#8220;Why is M. Selden present at this discussion?
Is he a witness?&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden, suddenly crimson, started to rise, but Madame
Ghita waved him imperatively back into his
seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not objecting to your presence, monsieur,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
she said quickly. &#8220;Pray do not take offence. But I
should like to understand it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;M. Selden is not here of his own choice,&#8221; explained
the countess. &#8220;He is here because I asked
him to come. As a witness, perhaps; but a witness
for you, madame, not for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not understand,&#8221; said Madame Ghita
slowly, her eyes full upon Selden&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame,&#8221; said the countess, weighing each word
and watching its effect, &#8220;M. Selden is, as perhaps
you do not know, a very great journalist. Unfortunately
he has always been an admirer of republics,
but the baron has, I think, convinced him that in this
case the monarchy can do more for our country than
is possible for the present republic. M. Selden&#8217;s
support will mean a great deal to the monarchy,
and the baron has laboured hard to get it; but one
scruple remained in M. Selden&#8217;s mind&mdash;the fear that
you would be wronged too much&mdash;that you would
not be treated fairly. So I asked him to be present
to-day in order that he might see for himself what
your feeling is. He has warned me more than once
that he is here as your ally.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was wonderful to see the change which came
into Madame Ghita&#8217;s eyes as this explanation proceeded&mdash;the
tenderness, the happiness of the look
she turned on Selden. And when it was ended, she
held out her hand to him across the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will forgive me, monsieur,&#8221; she said softly.
&#8220;I am very proud to have such an ally!&#8221;</p>

<p>And whether he raised her hand to his lips, or
whether it raised itself, he never knew&mdash;but as he
kissed those long, delicate fingers, he felt them flutter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
shyly against his mouth, like the wing of a
bird.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; said the countess, who had lost nothing
of all this&mdash;who had watched it indeed with the
satisfaction of a general who sees his plan of battle
succeed; &#8220;tell me you accept. There is nothing else
to be done&mdash;your good sense tells you so. What
would you gain by making a scene? You might prevent
this marriage&mdash;though even that is by no means
certain. But would that compensate you for ruining
the prince, upsetting the dynasty, and condemning
yourself to a life of poverty? There will never
again be a chance like this. If this is lost, all is lost.
You are still young....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Madame Ghita with a little smile,
&#8220;so there is no reason why I should lead a life of
poverty, unless I choose it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is true; but accept now, and you will have
something very few women have&mdash;independence.
You will be free to look for love&mdash;to wait for it!&#8221;</p>

<p>For an instant Madame Ghita&#8217;s eyes rested pensively
upon Selden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Independence; yes, that is very nice,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;But it is a pleasure to be dependent upon a man
when one loves him!&#8221; Then she looked at the
countess curiously. &#8220;I am astonished to find you on
this side&mdash;so eloquent! I had always understood
that you were Jeneski&#8217;s friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden knew that the countess flushed, though
his eyes were on the table. But her hand was in
the range of his vision, and he saw that it was
trembling.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is long since finished,&#8221; she said, a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
thickly. &#8220;The baron is a much older friend&mdash;and I
am doing what I think best for my country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And for me also?&#8221; asked Madame Ghita, with
a strange smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; for you also. Can you doubt it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again there was a moment&#8217;s silence. Then Madame
Ghita looked across at Selden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, M. Selden,&#8221; she said, &#8220;since you are my
friend and my ally, what do you advise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, madame,&#8221; protested Selden, with a gesture
of helplessness, &#8220;how can I advise? I do not know
what is in your heart!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if my heart is not concerned?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said Selden, a little coldly, &#8220;I
should by all means advise you to accept!&#8221;</p>

<p>He was looking at her now&mdash;at the vivid, mobile
mouth with its little mysterious smile; at the eyes
curiously intent, as though experience had taught
her that she must look into people&#8217;s minds as they
talked in order to get their full meaning. And suddenly
she burst into a peal of laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;How serious you are!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;And how
shocked if, by any chance, a woman tells the truth!
Come, it is settled! I accept! The prince shall
have his little American with her millions, the king
shall have his throne again, Lappo shall have his
heart&#8217;s desire, and I&mdash;I shall have a hundred and
fifty thousand francs a year, and shall be free to look
for love! So we shall all be happy! It is understood
of course that the hundred and fifty thousand
will be mine to do with as I please?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But certainly!&#8221; said the countess, looking at her
curiously. &#8220;There are no restrictions.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>&#8220;And you, Madame la Comtesse, what do you
get? A new title? To serve one&#8217;s country, yes,
that is very noble; men have died for their country;
but for a woman it is not enough!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said the countess, sombrely, &#8220;that is my
secret! Perhaps you will know some day!&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame Ghita looked at her for a moment with
that clear and penetrating gaze; then she pushed
back her chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our business is arranged, then,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and
I must be going. I have a niece to look after. I
promised her that I would not be long. Madame, I
have to thank you for a most delightful luncheon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I also,&#8221; began Selden, but the countess stopped
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will remain for a moment,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Madame Ghita flashed an ironic glance into Selden&#8217;s
face. What she saw there seemed to amuse
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Au revoir, alors,&#8221; she said, and in a moment she
was gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you see I was right,&#8221; commented the countess,
as the door closed behind her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Selden, a wry smile upon his lips.
&#8220;Yes; she is, as you said, a sensible woman!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Every woman in her position has to be sensible,&#8221;
the countess pointed out. &#8220;She may treat herself to
nerves occasionally, but she must never lose her
head. And she is right&mdash;absolutely right!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, of course she is right!&#8221; agreed Selden, a
little bitterly. &#8220;But sometimes it is better to be
wrong&mdash;gloriously wrong!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not misjudge her,&#8221; said the countess quickly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
&#8220;She may not be at all sensible in the way you think.
It was not because of the money she accepted&mdash;I am
sure of it. I doubt if she will even use it for herself&mdash;you
heard her stipulate that she might use it as
she pleased.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Selden; &#8220;but that would be very&mdash;ah&mdash;unusual.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is an unusual woman. And if she ever loves
a man&mdash;really loves him&mdash;that man will be very
fortunate; do you not think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly,&#8221; agreed Selden, trying to speak
lightly. &#8220;I only hope she finds the right one!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; said the countess. &#8220;I am sure she
will!&#8221; she added, with a little smile.</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment, looking at Selden&#8217;s
troubled face, as though hesitating whether or not to
say something more.</p>

<p>&#8220;At least,&#8221; she went on, at last, &#8220;your compunctions
in that direction are at an end?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I go to Nice this afternoon, as you know, to see
Miss Davis. Then my work will be finished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are going away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I shall not stay here. But I shall tell you
to-night how my mission succeeded.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you forgotten,&#8221; she asked, with a smile,
&#8220;that you invited me to dinner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me!&#8221; he said, confused. So much had
happened since that invitation was given! &#8220;Of
course!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At Ciro&#8217;s,&#8221; she went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, at Ciro&#8217;s,&#8221; he assented.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>There was an ironic light in her eyes as she looked
at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see you are not very keen for it,&#8221; she said;
&#8220;but I have a very special reason for wishing to dine
with you at Ciro&#8217;s to-night. So you will be good
and take me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, of course I&#8217;ll take you,&#8221; he said, and registered
a mental vow to give her the best dinner Ciro&#8217;s
could produce. &#8220;I shall be proud to take you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very nice, you know,&#8221; she said, her head
a little on one side. &#8220;Sometimes I almost regret that
you do not care for me&mdash;but no, it is better as it is!
I am going to see that you are rewarded. Now do
not ask any questions!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Selden. &#8220;I will call for you at
nine,&#8221; and he took his leave.</p>

<p>Once in his room, he got into robe and slippers,
filled his pipe and threw himself on the chaise-longue.
He must reason this thing out&mdash;he must
find the key to what was in the minds of these two
very subtle women.</p>

<p>Why had the countess looked at him so strangely?
What was the reward she planned for him?</p>

<p>And what had Madame Ghita meant by &#8220;friend&#8221;?
What was it she had said?</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you were Jeneski&#8217;s friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>Why had that long white hand trembled so?</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV<br />


THE LIONS ROAR</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE <i>London Times</i> does not reach Nice until
five o&#8217;clock in the evening, but by the middle
of the morning a crowd of newspaper men,
diplomats and motley adventurers were besieging
the gates of the Villa Gloria. As the baron had
foreseen, Selden&#8217;s telegram had caused a considerable
flutter at many London breakfast tables.</p>

<p>Lord Curzon, for example, who, heaven knows,
is not easily moved from the prearranged and almost
godlike tenor of his ways, reached his office ten minutes
earlier than usual, wired Paris for a confirmation,
and called in his Balkan expert and his financial
adviser for a conference that lasted nearly an hour,
at the end of which a long telegram of mingled advice
and admonition was sent to Jeneski and another
to the ambassador at Paris, informing him that the
attitude of the British foreign office would be strictly
neutral&mdash;which meant, of course, that if the king
could get back his throne, pay off his debts to Britain
and open up some trade, the Empire would have
every reason to be gratified.</p>

<p>All the Balkan ambassadors proceeded to warm
up the wires between London and their several capitals,
most of them sending Selden&#8217;s article in full in
order to avoid the bother of composing something
out of their own heads, and then repaired to Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
Curzon&#8217;s ante-chamber to inquire what the British
government was going to do about it. Lord Curzon,
of course, hadn&#8217;t the slightest intention of telling
any one what he was going to do about it, even
if he knew himself, but he concealed this fact behind
a cryptic manner and a Jove-like demeanour. He
gave Jeneski&#8217;s ambassador an extra minute, on the
strength of which that worthy sent a hopeful telegram
to his master.</p>

<p>But neither of these telegrams reached Jeneski,
nor did the ones from Paris, Brussels and Belgrade,
for by the time they had been relayed through to
his capital, Jeneski had departed. Nobody knew
he had departed, except three of his ministers whom
he had called together in the early morning to read a
telegram which had just arrived from Nice; the general
impression was that he was suffering from a
slight cold; but as a matter of fact he was in an airplane
flying across the Adriatic.</p>

<p>As Selden had suspected, there was no lack of decision
about Jeneski in a critical moment, but even
his ministers wondered what he could hope to accomplish
at Nice. Two of them were strongly of the
opinion that he should stay at home and begin at
once to organize his forces; if it got about that he
had left the country, the effect would be very bad.
The royalists might even attempt a counter-revolution.
The third one urged him by all means to go,
but it was in the secret hope that he would fall into
the Adriatic en route, and the way be opened for the
king and the millions he would bring with him. Perhaps
Jeneski suspected this, but he started just the
same.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>The stir in London was not only in the diplomatic
dovecotes, for a number of people of no discoverable
occupation either sent urgent telegrams in cipher
or else suddenly discovered that they needed a rest
on the Riviera and booked places on the afternoon
boat-train. And, of course, the foreign editor of
every newspaper wired his Nice correspondent (or
his Paris correspondent, if he had none at Nice) an
inquiry, more or less polite, as to how the devil he
had come to miss this important piece of news.</p>

<p>During the day, this commotion spread to the continent,
and from Paris, Rome, Vienna, Lucerne,
hopeful adventurers turned their faces toward Nice,
like vultures gathering for a feast, all of them
anxious to assist in the restoration of a dynasty so
well fortified with real money in the shape of American
dollars.</p>

<p>All of which was brought forcibly to Selden&#8217;s notice
about the middle of the afternoon when he was
startled out of his thoughts by the ringing of his
&#8217;phone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;what is it?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Allo! Is this M. Selden?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Allo! This is the manager.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; what is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Allo! There are some people here to see you,
M. Selden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know who they are, monsieur,&#8221; said the
manager, &#8220;but they say they are journalists and that
it is necessary they see you at once. I hope there
has been no scandal....&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>&#8220;Reassure yourself,&#8221; Selden laughed. &#8220;Cause
them to be sent up to my room, if you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>Three minutes later there was a bang on his
door, which was flung open without further ceremony&mdash;as
he had been so certain it would be that he
had not taken the trouble to rise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he said, as they rushed upon him,
&#8220;what&#8217;s the matter with you fellows, anyway?
Why, hello, Scott&mdash;I&#8217;m mighty glad to see you. I
didn&#8217;t know you were down here,&#8221; and he shook
hands with Paul Scott, of the <i>Daily News</i>, the comrade
of many a campaign and one of the best-informed
men on international affairs in Europe.
&#8220;Now what&#8217;s eating you?&#8221;</p>

<p>There were perhaps a dozen men in the crowd,
and he nodded to the others that he knew.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know well enough what&#8217;s eating us, you
damn pirate,&#8221; said Scott grimly. &#8220;Since when have
you been the publicity man for that old toreador
over at Nice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t tackled that job yet,&#8221; said Selden; &#8220;I&#8217;m
still working for the <i>Times</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why should he send us all over here to see
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he do that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he did just that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe he wanted to get rid of you,&#8221; suggested
Selden with a chuckle. &#8220;But sit down, Scott. Sit
down, the rest of you, if you can find chairs. Now
let&#8217;s have the story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My story,&#8221; said Scott, taking off his hat and
wiping his forehead, &#8220;is simply this. I came down
here partly to get a rest, partly to interview old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
Clemenceau when he gets back from India, and I
expected to have a few days just to loaf around.
But this noon I get a telegram from Lawson asking
if I wake or if I sleep, and outlining that beat you
put across. After I had cooled off a little, I put on
my hat and hunted up the villa where the king lives.
There I found these boys kicking their heels
outside the gates and discussing a polite little note
which the king&#8217;s secretary had just brought out to
the effect that there was nothing to be added to your
story of yesterday evening, and that he was very
busy and must beg to be excused, but would be happy
to see us at six o&#8217;clock. He was busy all right&mdash;a
blind man could see that!&#8221; Scott added impartially.</p>

<p>&#8220;Busy doing what?&#8221; Selden queried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Busy receiving all the diplomats in Nice&mdash;to say
nothing of the shady characters from various down-and-out
circles&mdash;all the birds of prey along the
Riviera.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was letting them in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A good many got past the gates. How
much farther they got I don&#8217;t know. Old Buckton,
the British consul, came out while I was there, red
as a turkey-cock and grinning all over; and our own
ineffable Hartley-Belleville, who couldn&#8217;t have had
any possible business there, but has to be in on everything!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, and then what?&#8221; asked Selden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;some of these fellows represent evening
papers, and couldn&#8217;t wait till six o&#8217;clock, and we sent
in a round-robin pointing this out. And what do you
think old Pietro did? He sent out your address and
referred us to you! Fierce, wasn&#8217;t it? Well, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
swore awhile, and then we tumbled into some cars
and rushed over here. Now stand and deliver!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want to know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Selden, and filled his pipe. Scott
also fished his out of his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I suggest that monsieur speak in French?&#8221;
asked one of the French correspondents, who had
followed this rapid interchange with the utmost difficulty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there anybody here who doesn&#8217;t understand
French?&#8221; Selden asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I guess not,&#8221; said Scott. &#8220;Fire ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Selden told the story very much as he had told
it in his telegram, with perhaps an added detail or
two and a little more colour, and they all sat and
listened, and the Frenchmen made notes of the unfamiliar
American names and asked how they were
spelled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I always thought you were a democrat,&#8221; said
Scott, when he had finished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet I infer from your tone that you are in favour
of letting this old reprobate bribe his way back to
power.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t have to do any bribing. When his
people know he has some real money to spend on
the country, they&#8217;ll be only too anxious to have him
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be true&mdash;but it is bribery just the same&mdash;only
wholesale instead of retail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is national interest&mdash;self-preservation&mdash;exactly
what every country is governed by.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>&#8220;I seem to remember some articles of yours in
which you were rather dippy about Jeneski and his
new republic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but I didn&#8217;t foresee this alternative. You
know conditions over there, and how much good this
money will do. Besides, there is a certain poetic
justice in putting it back into the country of the
people who earned it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scott grunted sceptically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just how many millions are there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. They ought to be able to find that
out in New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How old is the girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About twenty-three, I should say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where does she live?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In Cimiez somewhere&mdash;I think the family has a
villa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty-two Avenue Victoria,&#8221; piped up one of
the Frenchmen. &#8220;It is almost impossible to get inside&mdash;when
one does, it is always the same thing,
&#8216;Please go away&mdash;not at &#8217;ome!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment Selden&#8217;s telephone rang.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; he said, and picked up the receiver.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Danilo talking,&#8221; said the prince&#8217;s voice,
when assured that he had Selden on the wire. &#8220;The
king has requested me to speak with you. All day
there have been journalists asking&mdash;demanding&mdash;to
see him. Naturally he does not wish to offend them,
and he has therefore promised to see them at six
o&#8217;clock. He very much wishes you also to be present.
He will send a car for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;I can get over,&#8221; said Selden. &#8220;I shall be
very glad to come.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said the prince. &#8220;Good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; said Selden, and glanced at his watch.
It was a few minutes after four. &#8220;That is all I can
tell you fellows now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s all I know.
Perhaps we shall learn something more at six
o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>The men who served evening papers hurried away
to get off their stories, hoping to catch the last edition.
The others departed more leisurely. Scott
remained till the last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, old man,&#8221; he said, when the door
was shut, &#8220;what do you really think about this affair?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m willing to give the king a try,&#8221; said Selden.
&#8220;Perhaps the war has taught him something. If he
doesn&#8217;t make good, he can always be fired out again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be so easy the next time,&#8221; Scott pointed
out. &#8220;Besides, it isn&#8217;t the king&mdash;it&#8217;s Danilo. There
is one detail you didn&#8217;t mention.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That he has a morganatic wife. It&#8217;s perfectly
well known in Paris. These fellows are all going
to play it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One of them has even dug up an old picture of
her&mdash;as a ballet dancer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was she a ballet dancer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;at the Op&eacute;ra. But you don&#8217;t mean to tell
me you didn&#8217;t know about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I knew about it; but look here, Scott&mdash;she
may have been a ballet dancer&mdash;I don&#8217;t know; but
I met her to-day and I found her an extraordinary
woman.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>&#8220;Is she staying here?&#8221; Scott inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; she and a niece.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221; said Scott, and Selden knew as well as if
he had said it, that Scott had made up his mind to
find her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Interview her by all means, if you can,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll see in a minute that it will be an outrage
to drag her through the mud.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to drag her through the mud,&#8221;
Scott protested; &#8220;but of course I&#8217;ve got to mention
the marriage and it can&#8217;t do any harm to see the
lady. I was wondering, though, how that angle of
the story will strike them over in America.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have stopped wondering how anything will
strike them over there!&#8221; said Selden.</p>

<p>Scott grinned cheerfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know we are not in the League yet. But
this marriage story may make a difference. Doesn&#8217;t
it make any difference to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a particle&mdash;and it won&#8217;t make any difference
to anybody. Most Americans have been so
stuffed with cheap romance and pseudo-memoirs and
backstairs gossip&mdash;to say nothing of the movies!&mdash;that
they consider a morganatic wife and two or
three mistresses as natural to a prince as&mdash;well,
as two legs or two arms. He is incomplete without
them!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps so,&#8221; Scott agreed; &#8220;but I should think
it would make some difference to the girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were she, I&#8217;d prefer him to have had one
wife rather than a dozen mistresses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is one way of looking at it, of course,&#8221;
said Scott slowly; &#8220;but as a matter of fact, one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
woman is far more dangerous than a dozen. Does
she intend to let the prince go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, in that case, I suppose it&#8217;s all right,&#8221;
said Scott, and rose. &#8220;She <i>must</i> be an extraordinary
woman. See you at six,&#8221; and he put on his hat and
walked out.</p>

<p>For a long time Selden sat staring at the door.
Would Madame Ghita let the prince go? After all,
that was not the bargain&mdash;she had agreed merely
not to make a scene....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Selden took care not to reach the Villa Gloria in
advance of six o&#8217;clock. He wanted to go in as the
others did. But he had taken the precaution to get
the king&#8217;s secretary on the &#8217;phone and to give him
certain advice to be passed on to his master. So
they found the prince with his grandfather when
they were ushered into the salon. Both of them
were in the national costume. It was the first time
that Selden had seen the prince so attired, and he
found him much more attractive than in the ordinary
garb of western Europe. The colours suited his dark
hair and skin admirably. He even had a little of
his grandfather&#8217;s dignity.</p>

<p>As for the king, no one could have looked more
regal; nothing could have surpassed the urbanity of
his greeting as he shook hands with the correspondents
one by one. There were a lot of them by this
time&mdash;Italian, French, American, English&mdash;among
the latter Halsey, returning the king&#8217;s smile with an
expression which seemed to Selden distinctly sardonic.
But then Halsey was always sardonic&mdash;there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
was something wrong inside of him. Perhaps, as
the French would say, he listened to himself too
much! He caught Selden&#8217;s eye as he turned away
from the king, but made no sign of recognition.
Evidently he had cut Selden from his list of acquaintances!</p>

<p>&#8220;I am desolated, messieurs,&#8221; said the king, &#8220;that
I was not able to receive you earlier, but I have been
very much engaged. It has astonished me, the interest
awakened by the announcement of my grandson&#8217;s
betrothal. And I have been deeply gratified
by the felicitations which I have received.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Official felicitations, sir?&#8221; asked Halsey.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the king. &#8220;Those, of course, must
wait upon the formal announcement, which will be
issued in a few days. It is delayed only until the
date of the wedding is agreed upon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The wedding will be soon, no doubt, sir?&#8221; inquired
one of the Italians.</p>

<p>&#8220;As soon as the necessary arrangements can be
made. The Baron Lappo, my minister, is already in
Paris to that end. I need not tell you gentlemen
how gratified I am to be allied to this powerful
American family, which will enable us to do so much
for our fatherland. Mlle. Davis shares this enthusiasm.
I assure you that you will find her, when you
meet her, to be everything that a queen should be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A queen, sir?&#8221; asked Halsey, quickly. &#8220;A
restoration is planned, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is at least envisaged,&#8221; said the king. &#8220;I am
going to ask my people to choose, and I have not
the slightest doubt what their choice will be. But
whether or not we succeed, I am still king, monsieur,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
and my grandson will be king after me and his son
after him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We should like very much to meet the lady,&#8221;
some one suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will see if it can be arranged,&#8221; said the king.
&#8220;There is one thing more I wish to say to you. It
is no secret that some years ago my grandson contracted
a morganatic marriage with a young lady
in Paris&mdash;a lady for whom I have the very highest
respect and esteem. This marriage was contracted
in the regular way and no attempt was made to conceal it.
We are in no way ashamed of it, and I
should much regret to see it made the basis of scandal
or innuendo. The prince and this lady have
been happy together; but the hour has come, foreseen
from the beginning, when they must part. It is
not an easy thing to do; but they do it with brave
hearts for the sake of my country. I find it admirable,
this sacrifice; I hope it will appeal to you, messieurs,
also, and that you will treat it tenderly.&#8221;</p>

<p>It could not have been better done; it was evident
that, to the Latins at least, the romantic appeal
was irresistible. But on Halsey&#8217;s countenance the
sardonic expression grew a little deeper. And the
face of the prince was also a study.</p>

<p>Then somebody said something about photographs,
and the king summoned his secretary and
instructed him to provide them, and then he shook
each man by the hand again, and so did the prince,
and the interview was over.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a wonder,&#8221; said Scott, as they went out
together, and that seemed to sum up pretty well the
impression the king had made on all of them, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
judge by the comments of the crowd. Most of them
were of amused admiration at the way the old king
managed to carry things off. He was a poseur,
yes; he was a medi&aelig;val old fossil, yes; but he had
always been a friend of the journalist&mdash;an inexhaustible
source of copy. So why not be kind to him?
After all, what did it matter who ruled over the few
square miles of barren mountains that constituted
his kingdom. They were all a little weary of reformers
and patriots&mdash;so many of them had proved
to be mere wind-bags, or worse! Yes, they would
be kind to the king. Even Scott smiled and said,
&#8220;Oh, well, let&#8217;s give the old boy a chance!&#8221;</p>

<p>Only, Selden noticed, Halsey did not join in this
discussion, but hurried away, as soon as he had
passed the gates, as though to keep an appointment.
Undoubtedly there would be a slashing article in the
<i>Journal</i>. Halsey had unusual powers of invective
when he let himself go.</p>

<p>But perhaps the countess would stop him.</p>

<p>Well, Selden told himself, in either event he did
not care. He was only an outsider looking on at the
comedy and applauding the bits that appealed to him.</p>

<p>And yet&mdash;was that all? Or had he been involved?
Had he a stake in the game?</p>

<p>But a ballet dancer ... a woman who was for
sale....</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI<br />


AT CIRO&#8217;S</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was to Ciro&#8217;s that Selden had promised to
take the countess that evening, and remembering
his resolve to give her the best the place had
to offer, he drove there, before going to his room,
to reserve a corner table and have a word with the
head waiter.</p>

<p>He found that worthy, of course, most anxious to
oblige, and fertile in suggestion. There had just
arrived a shipment of marennes, vitesse, from La
Gr&egrave;ve; they would be delicious; yes? good, monsieur.
For soup, petite marmite, perhaps; no, that
would be too heavy; cro&ucirc;te-au-pot would be better;
good. For fish, a sole, perhaps, or a trout prepared
in a special way; no&mdash;one moment; Jean, bring
hither that basket of langouste; behold, monsieur,
how fresh, how sweet, and not too large; this one;
good; for garniture, trust me, monsieur. And then
partridges, perhaps, or a wild duck; no&mdash;permit me
to suggest pauillac, monsieur, pauillac v&eacute;ritable, very
young, very tender, truly fed with milk, delicious;
with asperges; good. And for entremet monsieur
wishes cr&ecirc;pes susettes; good. For wine, Martinis
first, of course; then a little Sauterne with the
oysters; and then what would monsieur prefer?
Champagne? No. Bordeaux, Burgundy? Permit
me, monsieur, to suggest a Chateauneuf du Pape of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
which we are very proud&mdash;1915, the great year&mdash;and
from the special vineyard just above Avignon;
good. At nine o&#8217;clock? It shall be ready, monsieur.
Au revoir, monsieur; merci bien. And Selden went
on to the hotel feeling as though he had assisted at
a sacrament.</p>

<p>So at nine o&#8217;clock, behold him, seated beside the
Countess R&eacute;mond on the banquette at a corner table&mdash;the
langouste, with garniture of pink jelly and
ornaments of truffles, proudly displayed near by&mdash;ready
to talk, to listen, to dine, and to observe the
world at its gambols.</p>

<p>For Ciro&#8217;s is not only the pleasantest restaurant
at Monte Carlo, but the most discreet as well,
for there, sitting in view of all the world, one can
talk of the most intimate things much more safely
than in a private room, with the certainty that one&#8217;s
voice will be lost in the lively medley of dancing
feet and music and other voices with which the place
is always filled.</p>

<p>And one can dine well, also; though not quite so
well, perhaps, as in the old days, for there is a new
proprietor. The former one, a handsome, slim
Italian who had kept his youth while his wife had
lost hers through excessive libations, suddenly quarrelled
with her, sold his business and took train to
Paris, where he now manages a restaurant, small
and very intime, known only to the elect, two steps
from the Avenue de l&#8217;Op&eacute;ra. He is a pleasant fellow,
with a record of many conquests; but he goes
to see his wife sometimes at the lodging house which
she now conducts in the Rue St. Georges, and his
two daughters who are very fond of him; and sends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
them champagne for their r&eacute;veillon and their f&ecirc;te
days; and the chef he took with him now delights
his very discriminating Parisian patrons.</p>

<p>The new proprietor is not as handsome as the old,
and his chef lacks that indefinable something which
distinguishes the great artist; but he is capable and
not without imagination, and it is only by comparison
that he suffers. The sommelier is the same, so
the cellar is all that could be desired. No one can
surpass him at a dry Martini. Selden watched him
fill the little glasses, then leaned back with a sigh of
content and looked at his companion.</p>

<p>She was uncommonly arresting, with her air of
distinction, her eyes a little tilted and fatigued&mdash;consummate
art again! She had chosen a black gown of
some filmy material which foamed up over her
breast, accentuating its whiteness and delicate contour
and the grace of her arms and shoulders. Her
only ornament was again that strange stone of
greenish-yellow which matched her eyes. She was
by all odds the most interesting woman in the room;
the eyes of the other men were wandering toward
her constantly&mdash;yes, and the eyes of the women, too,
but with a different expression.</p>

<p>For whom had she arrayed herself, Selden wondered.
He was sure it was not for him, and he
looked at the other men, but he knew only one of
them. That was old Scott, who was dining by himself
at a table across the room. He looked at
Selden&#8217;s companion with marked interest, and bowed
elaborately when he caught Selden&#8217;s eye. But Selden
answered only with a curt nod which warned
Scott as clearly as anything could to keep away.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
Selden had no objection to his meeting Madame
Ghita, but there was no reason why he should know
the countess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is your friend?&#8221; she inquired, as she drew
off her gloves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a newspaper man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your bow was not very cordial,&#8221; she commented.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;I don&#8217;t want him interfering with this dinner.
I don&#8217;t want anybody interfering!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody is going to interfere,&#8221; she assured him,
and picked up her Martini and touched his glass
with hers. &#8220;To the fulfilment of all our hopes!&#8221;
she said, and they drank together. &#8220;What happened
to you this afternoon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The press has broken loose,&#8221; he answered, and
told her of his adventures with his fellow correspondents
and of the interview with the king. &#8220;It
went off better than I expected,&#8221; he added. &#8220;All
the boys are inclined to give the old fellow a boost&mdash;all,
that is, except your friend Halsey.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned upon him quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you call him my friend?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t it Halsey we met on the terrace the
other morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he was waiting for you this morning also.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true&mdash;he is a great nuisance; but he can be
useful to me in a certain affair, and so for the moment
I tolerate him. That is all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden was certain she was lying, but the marennes,
lying so cool, so fresh, so green on their little
shells, demanded his attention. The ma&icirc;tre-d&#8217;h&ocirc;tel
stood anxiously by until he ate the first one and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
beamed triumphantly at his approving nod. Yes,
they were delicious.</p>

<p>&#8220;One reason I like to dine in a French restaurant,&#8221;
said Selden, &#8220;is because every one is so pleased
when one finds the food to one&#8217;s taste. In other
countries nobody really cares, you can take the food
or leave it; but here it is a matter of life or death;
at least, they make it appear so. And they are wiser
than we in another way. When a Frenchman enters
a restaurant, he puts his affairs, his worries, out of
his head; he thinks only that he is to eat; he is smiling
and happy; he allows nothing to hurry him, so
he enjoys his food and digests it easily. But the
American enters in a rush, thinking of his business,
or he brings a paper to read, or he gets out his
memoranda and makes computations between the
courses; so he not only does not enjoy his food, but
he does not digest it, and wonders why he has dyspepsia.
It is very foolish! Ah, here is the cro&ucirc;te-au-pot.&#8221;</p>

<p>It also was perfect; and then came the serving of
the langouste, a solemn ceremony performed by the
ma&icirc;tre-d&#8217;h&ocirc;tel in person, with two of the waiters as
acolytes. It was at this point that Selden tasted
the Chateauneuf du Pape, which the sommelier had
placed reverently before him, and knew definitely
that the dinner was a success.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you have told me nothing of your adventures,&#8221;
he pointed out. Halsey could rest for a
while; perhaps, later on, he might find a way to get
back to him. &#8220;You saw the Davises?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; and she laughed a little. &#8220;The family<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
Davis is having for the first time the experience of
being internationally important.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do they enjoy it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes&mdash;at least the mother does, enormously.
About the daughter, I am not so sure&mdash;she has
something at the bottom of her heart&mdash;something I
do not understand....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; he said, as she paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well,&#8221; she said, with sudden vehemence,
&#8220;what woman has not something at the bottom of
her heart&mdash;a little worm which gnaws and gnaws!&#8221;
She checked herself and touched her napkin to her
lips. &#8220;Do not heed me&mdash;it is nothing!&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment came the pauillac&mdash;those tender
and delicious ribs of milk-fed lamb from the country
below Bordeaux&mdash;and again the head waiter beamed
at Selden&#8217;s approving nod.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it was amusing,&#8221; went on the countess;
&#8220;those journalists camped about the place as at a
siege. They have a villa at Cimiez, the Davises&mdash;a
large place which they have taken furnished. They
have picked up their servants where they could, and
of course the servants are in no way loyal, but are
looking only to make all they can out of the rich
Americans. They had orders, those servants, to
admit none of the journalists, but first this one and
then that one would bribe his way in. But it was of
no use. It seems that Baron Lappo had impressed
upon Madame Davis that she was not to talk&mdash;not
a word to any one. He must have hinted at terrible
consequences, for she was quite awed, and all she
would say was &#8216;Please go away,&#8217; over and over again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
until the butler would come and lead the journalist
away. Indeed, she had rather the air of expecting
to be blown up, but she has set her heart upon being
the mother of a queen, and nothing will deter her,
not even assassination. She has even the idea that it
might be well to cement the union doubly by marrying
her son to the Princess Anna.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fancy she will have some difficulty there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but she is counting upon your assistance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My assistance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is going to ask you to talk to him, since it
seems he refuses to listen to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; said Selden, &#8220;if all this could be the
baron&#8217;s idea?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But of course&mdash;his or the king&#8217;s. They would
like to pluck the family clean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, young Davis will never marry the Princess
Anna.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not be too sure,&#8221; the countess warned him.
&#8220;The baron is one of the cleverest men in Europe&mdash;a
genius at manipulations of this sort. It is true
that in this case he has for an opponent a very clever
woman. You know very well that I mean Madame
Ghita,&#8221; she went on, in answer to his look, &#8220;and that
she destines that young man for this girl she calls
her niece.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have seen the girl,&#8221; said Selden. &#8220;She seems
very nice. Is she not her niece?&#8221;</p>

<p>The countess shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do I know? Cicette Fayard is the name
she goes by.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And she also will pluck him clean?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>&#8220;Can you doubt it?&#8221; asked the countess, a malicious
light in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Selden, philosophically, &#8220;since it
seems he is certain to be plucked, why worry? At
any rate, he will find the process more amusing at
the hands of Mlle. Fayard than at those of the baron
and the Princess Anna. It will do him good to get
some hard knocks. But what about his sister? Are
you free to tell me about your interview?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; it is as I thought. She has made up
her mind to carry it through. She was not astonished
or offended that the prince should have had a
mistress. In fact, I think she already knew it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You told her straight out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But of course&mdash;why should I use &eacute;quivoque?
She is not a child. I explained that I was speaking,
not because I considered the matter of great importance,
but because I wanted her to be treated
fairly and to understand everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did she say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She thanked me, entirely without warmth,&#8221; said
the countess, smiling. &#8220;She does not like me&mdash;I seem
to remind her of some one she dislikes very much.
Nor, to be frank, do I like her. It is instinct, I
suppose. We find ourselves antagonistic.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden decided that it was time to gather his
forces for the attack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you know her, out there in Montana?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw her, of course, but only a few times. She
was away at school a great deal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Last night she was looking at you as though
wondering where she had seen you before.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>&#8220;Yes, I noticed it. But I have changed a great
deal from the girl she saw occasionally; and a little
care in make-up changes me still more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I noted the oriental twist you gave yourself,&#8221;
commented Selden, with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I repeated it, of course, this afternoon, so she
could not place me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you did not recall yourself to her memory?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the countess, and her face darkened.
&#8220;I had a special reason for not doing so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden would have liked to know the reason, but
the countess did not explain it, and he could scarcely
ask. One thing was clear, however&mdash;the person
Miss Davis disliked very much, and of whom the
countess reminded her, was the countess herself.</p>

<p>His attention was distracted for the moment by
the solemn ceremonial attending the preparation of
the cr&ecirc;pes susettes. This too required the finished
touch of the head waiter, for whom an alcohol lamp
surmounted by a silver platter had been prepared.
He lighted the wicks of the lamp, filled the platter
with a sauce over which he had been working, whose
basis was fine champagne, and, as it began to simmer,
immersed in it one of the thin pancakes which
had been brought from the kitchen. He turned the
pancake over and over, sprinkled it with powdered
sugar, folded and refolded it, gave it a dash of
k&uuml;mmel, powdered it again, and popped it to a
plate in the hands of the attendant waiter, who
hastened to place it piping hot before the countess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please eat it at once, madame,&#8221; he implored.</p>

<p>And the countess ate it, while Selden&#8217;s was in
course of preparation. There were three for each of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
them&mdash;three indescribably delicious morsels, such as
only a French chef could conceive.</p>

<p>There had been a little bustle of new arrivals at
the door, which Selden was too preoccupied to heed.
And then he looked up to find Madame Ghita smiling
down at him&mdash;that peculiar little smile which always
puzzled him. She was perfectly gowned and
fully as arresting as the countess&mdash;more so, perhaps&mdash;though
on a different note; and with her were
two companions, Miss Fayard and young Davis.</p>

<p>Selden thought for a moment that she was going
to stop; but she did not&mdash;just nodded to them and
drifted past in the wake of the obsequious patron,
with the little fish-tail in which her clinging gown
terminated sliding noiselessly at her heels, and
making her look absurdly like a mermaid, a
siren....</p>

<p>Selden could not help smiling as he looked after
her&mdash;the deep spiritual smile with which one regards
a masterpiece.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, she is very striking,&#8221; the countess agreed;
&#8220;and very intelligent; do you not think so?&#8221; and she
looked at him curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I think so,&#8221; said Selden, with a heartiness
a shade artificial.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is too good for the prince,&#8221; the countess went
on. &#8220;She should have for her lover a great artist,
a poet, a dramatist&mdash;a great journalist like yourself;
she would arouse him, keep him awake, furnish
him with endless themes, and make his future. With
the prince her talents are wasted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; Selden suggested with elaborate carelessness,
&#8220;after this annuity business is settled, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
she has further consolidated her position by marrying
that girl to Davis, she will drop the prince and
look about her. I certainly hope so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked the countess quickly, still looking
at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; Selden explained, &#8220;the whole point of
the situation is not whether the prince has had a
mistress&mdash;but mistress isn&#8217;t the right word. After
all, he married her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With the left hand,&#8221; said the countess. &#8220;There
is a difference.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the question is not what the prince has
done, but what he is going to do. You will remember,
she hasn&#8217;t promised to give him up&mdash;only not
to make a scene.&#8221;</p>

<p>Involuntarily he looked across at the other table.
Davis and Miss Fayard had their heads together
over the menu. Madame Ghita was sitting with
folded hands gazing calmly across at Selden and the
countess. The latter had looked at her too, and so
she knew of course that they were talking about her.</p>

<p>Selden abruptly changed the subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you know young Davis&#8217;s father?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;he came to see my father quite often.
They were good friends. He was a very genuine,
human man. He and my father and Jeneski used
to sit for hours talking about all sorts of things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jeneski also?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He was a sort of deputy for Mr. Davis in
keeping the people in order. They were together
a great deal.&#8221;</p>

<p>The waiter had cleared the table and placed the
coffee before them. The sommelier, at a nod from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
Selden, filled two tiny glasses with golden Benedictine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jeneski is a remarkable man,&#8221; said Selden slowly.
&#8220;I found him very fascinating. I should think he
would be especially so to women.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is,&#8221; agreed the countess quietly; &#8220;the more so
because he finds women less fascinating than politics.
Oh, how do you do, Mr. Halsey,&#8221; she added, in another
tone.</p>

<p>It was indeed Halsey, who passed on with a curt
nod, sat down at a table facing them and ordered
coffee and liqueur. And looking at his sardonic face,
Selden began to glimpse the countess&#8217;s motive in insisting
on this dinner; she had need of Halsey&mdash;she
herself had said so&mdash;and she was disciplining him
when he proved recalcitrant. Well, one thing was
certain; he wasn&#8217;t going to be used as a stalking-horse
for Halsey. If he could only fathom the game
the countess was playing....</p>

<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t seem very happy,&#8221; he remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden nodded in Halsey&#8217;s direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he is never happy,&#8221; said the countess. &#8220;He
is one of those unfortunate men who never know
what they want&mdash;or when they do, are afraid to pay
the price. Come&mdash;I will not sit here with him glaring
at me. Besides, I have work to do&mdash;my reports
to make!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To Lappo?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was drawing on her gloves nervously. Selden
asked for the bill and paid it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I also have a telegram to send,&#8221; he said, as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
went out together. Over his shoulder he saw that
Halsey was paying his bill. He glanced at Madame
Ghita&mdash;she was looking after them with that
little ironical smile, which deepened for an instant
as she caught his eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. Selden,&#8221; said the countess, when they were
on the esplanade outside, &#8220;I have to thank you for
a lovely dinner&mdash;but more than that, for consenting
to take me. I shall not forget it. Perhaps I can
do something for you some day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can do something for me now,&#8221; said Selden.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Persuade Halsey to be decent about this affair
of the prince.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I do not....&#8221; She checked herself. &#8220;Very
well,&#8221; she said quietly. &#8220;I will see what I can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were at the hotel entrance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; Selden said. He did not look over
his shoulder, but he was certain that Halsey was not
far away. &#8220;I am not coming in&mdash;I&#8217;ll go over to the
postoffice and get my story off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good night.&#8221; She held out her hand. &#8220;It is
nice of you not to ask any questions. And if I do
not see you again....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are going away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I may be called away very suddenly. So if I do
not see you again, remember that I am your friend
and wish you good fortune!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; Selden answered. &#8220;Good night!&#8221;</p>

<p>For an instant she permitted him to retain her
hand, then she drew it away and walked quickly up
the steps. She waved at him from the top, and was
gone.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>As he turned the corner, he could not resist glancing
back. A heavy figure was running up the steps
to the hotel entrance&mdash;unmistakably Halsey.</p>

<p>Selden turned, with a sudden impulse, sped back
and up the steps into the hotel. He must solve this
mystery&mdash;at least he must establish beyond a doubt
the connection between Halsey and the countess.
He raced up the stair and reached the upper corridor
just as Halsey paused before the door of the countess&#8217;s
suite. It was evidently ajar, for he walked
straight in without knocking, leaving it open behind
him.</p>

<p>In an instant Selden was peering through the crack
between door and jamb. The countess was taking
a telegram from the hand of her maid.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; said Halsey roughly, as he burst in
upon her. &#8220;I agree&mdash;to anything....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; said the countess, without even glancing
at him, and ripped open the message with shaking
fingers. Her eyes devoured its contents at a glance.
Then she turned to him with a strange smile. &#8220;So
you agree?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You swear it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was time!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Look at this,&#8221; and
she thrust the sheet of paper beneath his eyes.</p>

<p>Halsey stared at it blankly.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Registered parcel wings mailed Nice this morning
okrim,&#8217;&#8221; he read. &#8220;What does that mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is from Mirko, Jeneski&#8217;s minister,&#8221; she said,
her whole body quivering, &#8220;and it means that Jeneski
started for Nice this morning by airplane.&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
Then, looking past him, she saw the open door.
&#8220;You fool!&#8221; she began....</p>

<p>But Selden was safely around the turn in the corridor
before the door slammed.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII<br />


A PROMISE</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SELDEN left the hotel and made his way down
to the terrace. He felt that he had need to collect
his thoughts, to arrange his ideas. He
walked up and down for a minute or two until the
blood stopped pounding in his temples, then sat
down on a bench and started to reason it out.</p>

<p>So the countess was in a plot against Jeneski&mdash;well,
that was nothing new; she had been on Lappo&#8217;s
side avowedly from the first. And that one of Jeneski&#8217;s
ministers should have been corrupted was easy
enough to understand. But the bearing of the
countess as she read that telegram&mdash;her emotion,
her fierceness, her passion&mdash;had torn a veil from
Selden&#8217;s eyes. She was not in this because of friendship
for Lappo, nor because she loved her country&mdash;she
herself had said it, &#8220;For a woman, that is not
enough!&#8221;&mdash;but for some personal reason, deep, compelling,
malignant. She hated Jeneski.</p>

<p>But where did Halsey come in? What did he
mean when he said, &#8220;I agree&#8221;? Agree to what?
Something he had held out against&mdash;something the
countess had driven him to. Perhaps it was only to
what Selden himself had suggested&mdash;to forego the
chance for a sensation. His air had been tragic&mdash;but
that would be a tragedy for Halsey&mdash;like cutting
off his right hand.</p>

<p>And his reward? Selden shrugged his shoulders.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
It was nothing to him what reward the countess
might choose to bestow. He cared not at all how
many men entered her rooms, nor how long they remained.</p>

<p>Poor old Halsey! He was surely running his
head into a noose! She was sure of him now&mdash;she
had left her door open, knowing that he would
follow! She had even made him swear! Heavens,
what a fool!</p>

<p>And then a sudden thought stung Selden to his
feet. Was Halsey the only fool?</p>

<p>What precipice was it toward which he himself
was walking, lured by the vision of a face which grew
more vivid with every hour, more dear&mdash;a face with
calm questioning eyes....</p>

<p>He would have to have it out with himself, the
whole question of his relations with this woman&mdash;this
Madame Ghita&mdash;this ballet dancer&mdash;this mistress
of a prince; what he hoped, what he feared;
have it out without evasion or self-deceit. And his
face was grim, for he foresaw that he would not
emerge with flying colours.</p>

<p>Hope? Pah!</p>

<p>The placid gardien sauntering by was startled to
see a man standing by the balustrade suddenly slash
viciously at the air with his cane, as though laying
it savagely across somebody&#8217;s back, and he slackened
his pace to observe this madman, who had
probably lost all his money, and to intervene if need
be. Perhaps he designed to cast himself on the railroad
tracks below. That must be prevented, because
it would cause a scandal, and scandals are
frowned upon most heavily at Monte Carlo.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>But there was no need of intervention, for the unknown,
after a couple of rapid turns up and down
the terrace, ran up the steps, and the gardien, following
cautiously, saw him turn into the postoffice,
and went back to his beat with a shrug of the
shoulders. It was not a madman, then; it was only
a fool who, instead of killing himself, was telegraphing
for more money!</p>

<p>That moment&#8217;s ebullition had relieved Selden; besides,
there was nothing to be gained by beating the
air. His immediate job was to get off his special to
the <i>Times</i>, and during those quick turns up and down
the terrace it had taken shape in his mind. First,
of course, a paragraph about the sensation which the
exclusive announcement in the <i>Times</i> had caused;
the crowd at the gates of the Villa Gloria; the call
made by the Hon. Percy Buckton and its apparently
satisfactory result, Mr. Buckton being the British
consul at Nice, and acting under instructions from
Lord Curzon, as to the character of which, however,
he would say nothing; the reception of the correspondents,
picturesque old king and scarcely less
picturesque grandson, creating most favourable impression;
Baron Lappo in Paris arranging the marriage
settlement; wedding to be very soon; frantic
efforts of the correspondents to see Miss Davis, who
had denied herself to everybody, except a personal
friend or two; it had, however, been the good fortune
of the <i>Times</i> correspondent to meet her; here
follow with short and complimentary description.
And then a discreet paragraph or two about the
morganatic marriage, quoting the king and treating
it as a thing of the past.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>But was it?</p>

<p>That was the crucial question. It was upon that
point, in Seldon&#8217;s mind at least, that the ethics of the
whole affair hinged. And it was there, he felt, that
he must seek some assurance better than the king&#8217;s.
There was only one place to get it; there was only
one person who really knew. For the matter lay
wholly in the hands of Madame Ghita. It was she
who would decide. It was from her that assurance
must be sought.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Half an hour later, at the booth in the postoffice,
he had completed his special and was about to sign
his name, when a sudden thought struck him. Well,
why not? And he added this final paragraph:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There is much speculation as to what line Jeneski will
take with respect to this affair. No one who knows him
believes for a moment that he will sit quietly by and permit
the republic for which he has struggled and which he believes
in so thoroughly to be overthrown without a contest.
He has to face no little opposition at home, even among his
own ministers, but he has shown himself before this to be
capable of rapid and decisive actions in a crisis. There is
a persistent rumour here that he left his capital this morning
by airplane for Nice. There is no confirmation of this
rumour, and no one can imagine what he hopes to accomplish
here, if he is really on his way, his arrival will
give a new twist to a situation already absorbing the attention
of many chancelleries.</p>
</div>

<p>He signed his name, pushed the sheet through
the window, waited to be assured that the message
had been started, and left the building.</p>

<p>Just across the way the great globes at the entrance
to the Sporting Club cast their light along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
the street, and Selden, without an instant&#8217;s hesitation,
turned toward them. He was certain that the
trio he had seen dining at Ciro&#8217;s would reach there
sooner or later, and he had made up his mind what
to do. He was going to demand an answer to the
question which was worrying him. He was going
to find out definitely what Madame Ghita intended
to do.</p>

<p>It was a little early yet for the club, but the rooms
were already filled and all the tables were in operation.
Selden strolled from one to another looking
for his quarry, and he soon discovered Davis and
Miss Fayard seated side by side and absorbed in
play. Davis was placing thousand-franc notes on
adjacent transversales, which gave him a chance on
nine numbers out of the thirty-seven, with a double
chance on three of them, and seemed on the whole
to be winning. His companion was betting more
moderately with plaques, or hundred-franc chips,
on the carr&eacute;s, four at a time, which gave her also a
chance on nine numbers; but she was less fortunate
and her last plaque was finally swept away. Davis
pushed some notes over to her and told her to go on,
and then he looked up and saw Selden watching
from across the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Come over here a minute.
I want to see you before you go,&#8221; he went on, when
Selden had worked his way to his side. &#8220;I&#8217;ve carried
out my part of the bargain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; and now I want you to carry out yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll talk it over,&#8221; Selden agreed. &#8220;Where is
Madame Ghita?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>&#8220;In the buffet, I think. A newspaper fellow got
hold of her a while ago. You&#8217;d better look them
up. I&#8217;ll join you as soon as I&#8217;ve busted the bank.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I can wait that long!&#8221; Selden protested,
laughingly returning Miss Fayard&#8217;s greeting,
and turned away to the buffet with considerable misgiving.</p>

<p>The instant he passed the door he saw Madame
Ghita, and, seated on the banquette beside her, talking
away earnestly, was Paul Scott. Selden was
conscious of a decided feeling of relief. Old Scott
wouldn&#8217;t do any harm. For some reason he had
feared that it was Halsey!</p>

<p>He approached them with a smile. Scott was too
absorbed in his talk to notice him, but Madame
Ghita had seen him at once, and his heart quickened
a little as her smile answered his.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evening, M. Selden,&#8221; she said; &#8220;this is
very nice. You will sit down, of course?&#8221; and she
made room for him on the banquette. &#8220;You know
Monsieur ... Monsieur....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Scott is the villain&#8217;s name,&#8221; said Selden, as he
sat down. &#8220;Yes, I know him&mdash;too well, indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>Scott, his discourse brought abruptly to a halt,
stared at him in indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;See here, Selden,&#8221; he said, &#8220;don&#8217;t you know that
when a gentleman is talking to a lady, third persons
aren&#8217;t wanted? It is plain that you are not a
man of the world! Run along now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like it very well here,&#8221; said Selden, settling
back in his seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then my seconds will wait on you in the morning,&#8221;
said Scott fiercely.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>&#8220;All right&mdash;coffee and pistols, eh? Only I&#8217;ll
take my coffee now,&#8221; and he told a waiter to bring
him some.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it that you are rivals?&#8221; asked Madame Ghita,
who had listened to this interchange in evident
alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Deadly rivals!&#8221; said Selden. &#8220;More than ever
at this moment. I welcome the prospect of ridding
myself of him forever! I must say you haven&#8217;t
lost any time,&#8221; he added to Scott. &#8220;Who introduced
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I used your name,&#8221; explained Scott, with a broad
grin. &#8220;It worked like a charm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true,&#8221; said Madame Ghita, her eyes sparkling,
for she was beginning to understand. &#8220;In the
rooms out yonder, ten minutes since, monsieur introduced
himself to me as a friend of yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The infernal impostor!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is his fault,&#8221; Scott protested, waving his
hands. &#8220;Figure to yourself, madame, this afternoon
he spoke of you in terms so glowing, so complimentary,
that I would have been less than a man
if my interest had remained unawakened. I made
up my mind to meet you. He even approved.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I consented,&#8221; Selden corrected; &#8220;I saw I might
as well. Now that you have met her, you&#8217;d better
beat it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beat it?&#8221; repeated madame. &#8220;What does that
mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am inviting him to make his adieux,&#8221; Selden
explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;I place myself in the hands of madame,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
Scott with a bow. &#8220;It shall be for her to choose
between us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, but that is too difficult,&#8221; she protested.
&#8220;Yet you must stay a little while, if only to tell me
what M. Selden said of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He said you were an extraordinary and fascinating
woman, madame,&#8221; said Scott, while Selden
turned a little crimson; &#8220;an opinion in which I fully
concur. So when I saw him to-night at Ciro&#8217;s with
a lady also of unusual charm, I could only infer that
it was you. I did not know that he had turned Turk
as well as Royalist. When, upon inquiry, I found
that it was not you, I confess that I was shocked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is true,&#8221; agreed madame; &#8220;I fear that
he is very, very inconstant!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I warn you against him, madame,&#8221; added
Scott, rising. &#8220;Be on your guard&mdash;I even hesitate
to leave you alone with him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are going? But it is not I who am sending
you away!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;it is duty compelling me. I have to get
off my story of to-day&#8217;s events.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye then,&#8221; said Madame Ghita, and held
out her hand, which Scott raised to his lips most
respectfully.</p>

<p>Then he paused for an instant to look quizzically
into Selden&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You old reprobate!&#8221; he snorted. &#8220;I see
through your game! But it&#8217;s all right!&#8221; he added.
&#8220;Will you have lunch with me to-morrow? At Amiraut&eacute;&#8217;s?
One o&#8217;clock? Good! Till to-morrow,
then!&#8221;</p>

<p>The two watched him until he passed from sight.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
Then Madame Ghita turned to Selden with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;A most amusing man,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and a very
great friend of yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, old Scott is all right; as square as they
make them. We have been in some close places
together. What was he talking about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was speaking of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of the work you have done and the ideals you
have fought for&mdash;I was very glad to listen; and
how surprised he was to find you on the king&#8217;s side
now; at least not bitterly fighting him&mdash;willing to
give him this opportunity; and how he was beginning
to understand and to take the same view, but
that it depended upon me, perhaps, that you should
never regret it. And then you came before he had
time to explain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will explain, madame,&#8221; he said, his heart very
tender toward old Scott, who knew him so well.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it does depend upon me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, madame; absolutely. When I came into
this club to-night,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;it was with the
hope of seeing you, for I must talk to you&mdash;quite
frankly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please do,&#8221; she said, her eyes shining. &#8220;I
should love to have you speak to me frankly. And
I&mdash;I also will be frank. I promise it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My regret, if I ever have any,&#8221; he went on,
&#8220;will not be for the king nor for his country. The
king takes his chance. As for the country, it will
be a great help to have this fortune spent there.
Afterwards, the people can choose another ruler if
they wish.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>&#8220;My own thought,&#8221; she nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;My regret will be for the American girl who is
involved in all this. She is contracting to place her
fortune and perhaps her happiness in the hands of
Prince Danilo. But he, too, is contracting something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a marriage; a very serious thing, you would
say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is serious to an American girl, at least,
madame. She knows, of course, of the prince&#8217;s alliance
with you. To that she can have no possible
reason to object&mdash;on the contrary; it has been an
honourable and recognized arrangement. But when
she marries him, she naturally expects that alliance
to cease.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well,&#8221; said madame, pensively, &#8220;the prince
is casting me off, is he not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but are you casting him off? You have
already told me that it is in your hands. You can
keep him, if you choose&mdash;no doubt of that! You
are the most fascinating woman, madame, that I
have ever known, and you are very clever. You
can do with a man what you will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even with you?&#8221; she asked, and looked into his
eyes. &#8220;Ah, no&mdash;do not lie. You are an American&mdash;there
is something in you, very deep down, which
holds you back from the supreme follies we Latins
commit so easily, and which even the English sometimes
achieve. I have seen it&mdash;how often! You
think it a merit; and because of it, at the bottom of
your minds, you believe yourselves superior to us
of Europe. Is it not so?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>&#8220;Perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But is it a merit? Is it not rather a cowardice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know, madame,&#8221; said Selden, humbly.
&#8220;I suppose we have not the same urge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is it&mdash;you have not the same urge. But
is that a thing to be proud of&mdash;to be more vegetable
than we are?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if we are happier so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Happy? Can one be happy without great moments?
Yes&mdash;as a cow is happy&mdash;as a sheep is
happy. But for me, that is not happiness&mdash;that is
ennui! I demand more than that! For me, happiness
is to risk everything on one turn of the
wheel!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;you are risking it now,&#8221; Selden pointed
out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, I am not!&#8221; she retorted quickly, and
leaned back a little wearily. &#8220;I am perhaps willing
to risk it, but the stake is too high&mdash;the bank refuses
to take my bet. Is it that the bank has other
bets?&#8221; and she looked at him sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am just an obtuse American, madame,&#8221; answered
Selden steadily, though his pulses were
pounding madly, &#8220;and not at all good at guessing
riddles.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him a moment longer; then her
eyes softened and a little smile played about her
lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are really very clever, M. Selden,&#8221; she said;
&#8220;very, very clever. I knew it the first time I saw
you&mdash;I looked at you well to make sure. And I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
have a great admiration for clever men&mdash;I have met,
alas, so few! But you were speaking of the prince.
Do you wish that I send him away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it would be best.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not asking what would be best, but whether
you wish it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I do,&#8221; said Selden brusquely.</p>

<p>He had had no intention of speaking those words,
of making that admission, of permitting it to become
in the slightest degree a personal matter, but some
force stronger than himself drove them to his lips.
And he was strangely glad that they were uttered.</p>

<p>She was looking at him with luminous eyes, her
parted lips trembling a little....</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; she said, softly. &#8220;I agree,&#8221; and
she touched his hand lightly with her fingers.
&#8220;That is finished.&#8221;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII<br />


REVELATIONS</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;I &nbsp;COULD be very angry with you if I wished,&#8221;
said Madame Ghita, presently, &#8220;at certain
things your attitude has seemed to imply. It
is true that I had never promised to give up the
prince; but you have appeared to think that I would
consent to share him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden was conscious that his cheeks were crimson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame,&#8221; he stammered, &#8220;madame....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not angry,&#8221; she said sadly; &#8220;only I regret
that you do not know me better. Perhaps if you
did, you would not have thought that of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I was a brute,&#8221; agreed Selden humbly, still
hot with shame and contrition. &#8220;Can you forgive
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But at least you will prescribe a penance,&#8221; he
persisted; &#8220;a severe one!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I?&#8221; she smiled at him. &#8220;Very well.
Hereafter you will be my friend, yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All my life,&#8221; he promised. &#8220;But that is not a
penance&mdash;that is a reward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, my friend,&#8221; she said, laughing, &#8220;do not be
too sure! I can be very exacting, sometimes. So
you may find it a penance&mdash;a very heavy one&mdash;before
you have finished!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>&#8220;I am proud to take the risk,&#8221; he said, covering
her hand for a moment with his own. &#8220;We must
pledge this friendship!&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded assent, and a waiter took the order
and hurried away.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it you propose to do with young Davis?&#8221;
asked Selden, after a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you concerned for him also?&#8221; inquired
Madame Ghita, drily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in the least&mdash;only curious. I suppose you
know that they are planning to marry him to the
Princess Anna?&#8221;</p>

<p>A flame of anger sprang into madame&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he wants too much, that old king!&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;He forgets that there are other people in the world.
Well, in this he shall be disappointed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will marry Davis to Mlle. Fayard, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will not be my doing&mdash;he loves her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I think he does,&#8221; Selden agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;And she is a good girl, Cicette; not very clever,
perhaps, but more clever than is he. She will make
him a good wife. Between us, we will educate him.
He is not bad at bottom, but he is very ignorant.
It seems impossible that any man should be so ignorant;
it is impossible except in America.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has never had to learn anything; he has
grown up with his eyes shut; he has been spoiled
by a mother who is too fond of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cicette is fond of him, but she will not spoil him&mdash;not
in that way. He has one great virtue&mdash;he is
kind hearted and generous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; remarked Selden; &#8220;too much so, perhaps.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
I noticed that he was staking Mlle. Fayard at the
table out yonder. That was not wise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it was not,&#8221; agreed madame quickly. &#8220;I
did not know it&mdash;I will see that it does not occur
again. Every one seeing it would believe that they
are lovers. But it is not true&mdash;I have taken care
of that; and, indeed, he has never suggested such a
thing. There is one point in the character of American
men which I find truly admirable&mdash;which even
gives me to marvel,&#8221; she added. &#8220;They are nice to
women without demanding anything in return; they
will help a girl, just for the pleasure of it, without
expecting to be paid in any other way. No other
men are like that. And Cicette&mdash;she is not silly.
Do you know what is her dream? To marry a good
man, to settle down, to have many children, and to
be faithful to her husband. That is the dream, perhaps,
of every woman,&#8221; she went on, musingly, &#8220;but
many of us cannot bring ourselves to make the necessary
sacrifices. We lack strength of character. Cicette
is different. She understands things; she will
be very good to him, and she will not expect too
much. He will be very happy with her. She will not
be exacting. She will guide him, without annoying
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heaven knows he needs guidance!&#8221; Selden
agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not oppose it, then?&#8221; she asked, looking
at him anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oppose it? What right have I to oppose it?
But I don&#8217;t even wish to; on the contrary, I
have half-promised to intercede for him with his
mother.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>&#8220;That is good of you!&#8221; she said, and her eyes
were shining again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come!&#8221; he protested. &#8220;I want to do it!
You are absurdly grateful for little things!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They have always meant so much to me&mdash;the
little things!&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, if I had any sense,&#8221; he went on
roughly, to hide his emotion, &#8220;I&#8217;d keep out of it,
since it is no affair of mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well,&#8221; she began, and stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were going to say that neither is his sister&#8217;s
future any affair of mine. But it is, in a way, since
without knowing it, I helped her to make up her
mind; so I want the prince to treat her fairly.
Where is the prince to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He telephoned that his father is ill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very ill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not think so. He has been exerting himself
too much. He forgets that he has eighty
years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a wonderful old man,&#8221; said Selden. &#8220;It
is a pity he did not pass on his qualities to his
grandson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps his great-grandson will inherit them,&#8221;
suggested madame, &#8220;and some American ones,
as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I confess,&#8221; said Selden, smiling, &#8220;that, absurd
as it may sound, something like that has been in my
mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How serious you are!&#8221; she commented. &#8220;Do
you plan that far ahead for yourself also?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To my great-grandson? Oh, no; I haven&#8217;t even
got to the children yet!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>&#8220;But you expect to marry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some day, perhaps. But not while I am merely
a wandering newspaper man. It wouldn&#8217;t be fair
to the woman. Some day, I suppose, I shall settle
down. The trouble is I don&#8217;t want to settle down&mdash;not
for a long time. You see, I&#8217;m like those
women you spoke of&mdash;not willing to make the necessary
sacrifices&mdash;without strength of character.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have not even a little friend?&#8221; she asked,
quite simply.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Oh, I don&#8217;t pose as a saint,&#8221; he added,
hastily. &#8220;But I have been tremendously busy and
tremendously interested in other things, which have
kept my mind occupied. Besides, I am a coward&mdash;I&#8217;m
afraid I&#8217;d marry her, if she was very nice to
me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are women who like to wander too&mdash;who
make good companions on the road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it, but....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Confess,&#8221; she broke in, &#8220;the real reason is that
you have never been in love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said soberly, watching the waiter as he
filled their glasses. &#8220;I am ashamed to confess it,
because it proves that I am lacking somewhere&mdash;but
I suppose that is the real reason.&#8221; He picked
up his glass and touched it to hers. &#8220;To our new
friendship, which will never grow old!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the nicest toast I ever drank,&#8221; she said,
and raised her glass to her lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; he went on, after a moment, &#8220;you said
something at lunch to-day which puzzled me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said to the countess that you had always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
understood she was Jeneski&#8217;s friend. What did
you mean by that?&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you very fond of her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not fond of her at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it true?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite true. She repels me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She took a quick little breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;All I know is what the prince has told me,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;that Jeneski was living with a woman known
as the Countess R&eacute;mond, whom he had met in
America, and who had been married to Lappo&#8217;s
illegitimate son, and that he had had a small estate
restored to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She hates Jeneski now,&#8221; said Selden. &#8220;They
quarrelled, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or perhaps he never was her lover&mdash;gossip like
that starts easily.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;she said something to me just to-night&mdash;what
was it? Oh, yes, that he found women less
fascinating than politics.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, so do you. So do most men&mdash;if not politics,
then something else&mdash;we are always second to
something. But that is as it should be&mdash;it is a sign
of strength. Life has taught me that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you would tell me something about your
life,&#8221; said Selden.</p>

<p>&#8220;You really wish it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard so many things....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well, you shall know the truth. I should
like you to know&mdash;though there is really not much
to tell. My father was a merchant of lace, a traveller,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
you understand, selling it to the shops in various
towns. One of these shops was at P&eacute;rigueux,
and was managed by a young woman with whom my
father fell in love. They married and moved to
Paris, where they opened a magasin&mdash;not to sell to
persons, but to other shops&mdash;you understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What we call a wholesaler.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. They did very well and the business grew
until it occupied the whole first floor of a building
on the Rue de Rivoli near the Chatelet. My
mother really managed it, but she found time nevertheless
to have two children&mdash;two girls. My
sister resembled her; but I resembled my father, and
he was very fond of me. He still travelled from
town to town, taking orders for the business; sometimes
he would take me with him. He would wash
and dress me in the morning, and comb my hair, and
in the evening I would sit at the table with all the
men, listening to their talk, and understanding more
than they imagined. We were very happy together;
but he was a strange man, and once he got an idea
into his head, it never left him. For example, he
had once lost a parcel through the carelessness of
a porter at a railway station, and had made a vow
that no porter should touch his baggage in future.
So at every stop, he would send the porters away
with dreadful insults and stagger along the platform
with his great cases of lace on his back, and I would
follow very much ashamed, for I could see that
people were laughing at him. However it made
no difference.</p>

<p>&#8220;But those good times did not last. My father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
began to gamble, and the habit grew so strong that
in the end my mother could scarcely find the money
to meet the bills each month. When he came home,
there were scenes, terrible scenes, during which he
sometimes threw all the dishes into the street.
Then he would promise to reform; but always the
habit was too much for him; it was like a disease,
getting worse and worse. I do not know what happened
at the end&mdash;I was only fourteen years old&mdash;but
one evening I went to his room to call him to
dinner. I knocked, but he did not answer. I
opened the door and saw him sitting in his chair
before his desk. I ran to him and threw my arms
around him, and he fell over against me. He was
dead. He had shot himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped for a moment, and passed her hand
before her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was the end of the business,&#8221; she went on.
&#8220;It was taken away from us to pay the debts&mdash;everything
was sold. My sister and I were sent to
England to a convent school&mdash;it was there I got such
English as I have&mdash;and mother went to work again
in a shop. It was very hard for her, but there was
nothing else to be done. We were gone three years.
When we came back, she had married again, a
ma&icirc;tre de danse at the Op&eacute;ra. He was old and
very eccentric and all that he wanted of my mother
was that she should make a home for him; and she
did, a very good one. It was not amusing, but it
was better than working in a shop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then came the war, and for a time there was no
more dancing, so to amuse himself and keep himself
occupied, he gave lessons to me and to my sister.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
With my sister he soon stopped and sent her to learn
to be a typist; but with me he kept on all day, every
day, until I dropped with fatigue&mdash;not dancing only,
but many other things&mdash;how to walk, how to talk,
how to acknowledge an introduction, how to hold
my fork, how to eat from my spoon&mdash;he said the
French are pigs because they take their soup from
the end of the spoon instead of from the side. He
was very clever&mdash;a little mad, perhaps. But to him
I owe everything.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was mad about the drama&mdash;but the classics
only. Whenever there was a great play at the
Com&eacute;die or the Od&eacute;on, he took me to see it&mdash;fortunately
he could get tickets, or we should have been
ruined. When there was no performance, we spent
the evening reading&mdash;Racine, Moli&egrave;re, Hugo&mdash;I
know them all by heart. And then when at last the
Op&eacute;ra opened again, every day he took me with
him to rehearsal, and before long I was in the ballet.
A year later, the premi&egrave;re danseuse fell ill one night
and I took her place and did so well that I was given
an engagement.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, perhaps, what the life of the stage is&mdash;there
are no reticences, no privacies. If you have
ever been to the Op&eacute;ra on the night of a ballet, you
have noticed that the front row of seats is empty
until the ballet is about to begin; then a number of
old men come in and take the seats. Most of them
have decorations; many of them are famous in art
or literature or diplomacy&mdash;and each carries an
opera-glass. They have come to see the girls&mdash;especially
the particular girl each of them is protecting;
and when the ballet is over, they come back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
and watch the girls dress and carry them off to supper
somewhere.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it was from that my step-father protected
me. He could not protect me from the knowledge
of what was going on, from the loose talk and coarse
jests; but at least I remained vierge. It was a
greater merit on his part than on mine, for those old
men disgusted me, but he could have made a little
fortune. Perhaps he had something else in his mind
for me&mdash;something greater. At any rate, in the
end he made my mother come with me to watch over
me better than he could, and every night I went
home between them. Everybody called them the
Dragons.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then, one night after I had danced very
well, the director brought Danilo back and introduced
him to my mother and to me. I thought him
very handsome and distinguished. Then my step-father
came and they talked together for many
minutes, my step-father shaking his head all the
time. Finally we went home, and my step-father
was very silent all the way.</p>

<p>&#8220;After that, the prince came back almost every
evening and talked to us, and brought me little gifts
of flowers and bon-bons. Once he gave me a ring,
but my mother made me return it. He scarcely
glanced at the other girls, though they did all they
could to attract him; and he had other talks with
my step-father. At last one day my step-father
took me to his study and bade me sit down.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;My child,&#8217; he said, &#8216;you are twenty-two years
old, and it is time you thought of your future. I
shall not be able to watch over you much longer, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
some day my weak heart will stop beating, and
before that I should like to see you range yourself.
This prince, now&mdash;what do you think of him?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;He is not bad,&#8217; I said, &#8216;but he is too young.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You are right, and if it was merely the question
of a protector, I would prefer an older man; he
would know better how to value you, and you would
have the benefit of his experience. But none of
those old fellows would marry you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Do you mean that the prince will marry me?&#8217;
I asked, astonished.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You will not be his wife, exactly,&#8217; said my step-father,
&#8216;and yet you will be more than his mistress,&#8217;
and he explained to me as well as he could what a
morganatic marriage is. &#8216;Some day he will have
to marry again for reasons of state, but by that time
you will have acquired a knowledge of the world, a
certain position, and should be able to look out for
yourself. He has not much money, but a prince
does not lack money like an ordinary man, for there
are always people willing to provide it just for the
privilege of being seen with him. It will be a great
education for you and I advise you to accept.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;But my dancing,&#8217; I objected.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;My child,&#8217; he said, &#8216;I will speak to you frankly.
You are a good dancer, but you will never be a great
artist. No&mdash;your place is in the world.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;But will his family consent?&#8217; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes. He has caused them many anxieties, and
they wish him to settle down with some nice girl
until they can find a very wealthy wife for him.
That is not possible at present. Of course they
will wish to see you. What do you say?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>&#8220;What could I say except yes? It was, as my
step-father said, a great opportunity&mdash;much better
than I could have hoped for. A few days later
Baron Lappo came to see me. He approved of me,
and so the marriage was arranged. Behold the
result,&#8221; and she offered herself with a little gesture,
as a showman might offer his wares.</p>

<p>&#8220;The result is wholly admirable,&#8221; said Selden.
&#8220;Yes, you were right to accept. And your step-father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His heart stopped beating one day as he had
foretold,&#8221; she answered, her lips trembling. &#8220;He
was the best man I ever knew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But your mother is living?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; she lives with my sister. My sister
married a little bourgeois shopkeeper. They manage
the business much better than he could.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Mlle. Fayard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is the daughter of my step-father&#8217;s younger
sister. I promised him to look after her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden looked at her musingly. How far she had
already travelled from her humble beginning! How
interesting it would be to watch her future&mdash;to see
what she made of herself, to what heights she rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you thinking?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am thinking you will go far,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Some
day a man will be prime minister because of you,
or there will be a great poem, a great play, a great
picture of which you were the inspiration; and I shall
go to the minister or to the artist and congratulate
him, and say, &#8216;Monsieur, I foretold this long ago,
one evening at Monte Carlo!&#8217;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>Her eyes were shining again and she laid her
hand lightly upon his.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you are right, my friend,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but
it is not of that I am thinking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you thinking?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I hope to find love some day,&#8221; she said,
and raised her hand for an instant to her eyes.</p>

SELDEN TAKES AN INVENTORY</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;I &nbsp; HOPE to find love some day!&#8221;</p>

<p>Those words were in Selden&#8217;s mind when
he went to sleep that night and when he awoke
next morning, and he lay for a long time thinking
of the woman who had uttered them and of the
story she had told him. To find love some day&mdash;there
was a fit ambition for every human heart!
But how often it was pushed aside by greed, by
cynicism, by selfishness, by fear&mdash;by any number of
cold and worldly things!</p>

<p>As it had been with himself. He could not but
admit it. Perhaps in some thin and far-off fashion,
he still hoped to find love some day; there had been
moments haunted by a vision of himself seated
cosily before a glowing hearth, and not alone; but
somehow, as the years passed, that figure sitting
there in slippered ease had grown older and older,
grey haired, even a little stiff in the joints from long
campaigning. It had remained himself, indeed, but
always himself thirty years hence.</p>

<p>For it is not only true that a rolling stone gathers
no moss, but wishes to gather none; as time goes on,
even grows to fear moss, or anything else that mars
the hard smoothness which enables it to keep on
rolling.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>Selden had been rolling, now, for many years. It
was his first assignment to foreign work, to cover
one of the Balkan wars, which had enabled him to
cast loose his anchors, and he had never been seriously
tempted to pick them up again. He had
come to love rolling for its own sake. The wandering
life of the special writer was congenial to his
blood. It was of intense interest, for it enabled him
to get past the fire-lines at every holocaust, and it
gave him a prestige, a sense of power, impossible to
any sedentary job. The thought of being chained to
a desk&mdash;of being chained even to a house&mdash;revolted
him. He wanted always to be able to throw his
things into a bag and take the road at a moment&#8217;s
notice, without the necessity of explanations to any
one, or anything to hold him back.</p>

<p>For a long time he had told himself that it was
his career he was jealous of&mdash;that nothing should
touch that. It should be his task to interpret Europe
to America and America to Europe&mdash;to labour
night and day to bring the peoples of the old and
the new worlds to a mutual comprehension and a
common interest. But of late, questionings had
crept in, whispered doubts. Was he really accomplishing
anything, was he really going ahead?</p>

<p>As he lay there that morning thinking it over,
taking such inventory of himself as he could, he
realized that it was no longer any thought for his
career which drove him on, but merely the force of
habit. He had reverted to type. The stone had
been rolling so long that rolling had become a second
nature.</p>

<p>For in spite of the convention which women sedulously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
foster and even sometimes believe, man is not
by nature a domestic animal. He has been partially
tamed by centuries of restraint, his spirit has been
broken by the manifold burdens laid upon him; for
generation after generation, all the pillars of society
have struggled to convince him that the greatest
blessings he can hope to win in this world are a wife
and children and that his highest privilege is to labour
to support them; all the forces of law, of civilization,
of public opinion, have conspired to hobble,
shackle and coerce him. And yet, in spite of everything,
he sometimes manages to break loose; while
few women suspect what moments of desperation
often overwhelm even the meekest father of a family.</p>

<p>Selden had broken loose. Now, at last, he was
beginning to wonder whether freedom was worth the
price.</p>

<p>As for his career, he had reached its apex. He
could go on writing specials, yes; he could go on
casting a feeble light into the dark corners of the
earth, dissecting the motives of public men, perhaps
influencing public opinion a little&mdash;a very little; but
he would never be any more powerful, any better
known, than he was at that moment. Indeed, his
influence and his fame must both diminish&mdash;imperceptibly
for a while perhaps, but none the less surely,
for he could not hope that the future would by any
possibility bring such opportunities as the past six
years had brought. From this point onward his
career could be only a descent.</p>

<p>Besides, he was himself growing weary of the
game. The world had gone stale, had gone cold and
sceptical. The fine enthusiasms, the wide sympathies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
the common brotherhood of war days had
waned and vanished. And his own enthusiasms had
vanished too. He remembered bitterly the ardour
with which he had gone to work to combat the traducers
of the League of Nations, and with what certainty
of success. He had felt sure of his country,
of her generous soul, her instinct for right, her
jealousy of her honour, and he had never recovered
from the shock when she denied the League. It had
left him stunned and incredulous.</p>

<p>He had buckled on his armour again and laboured
to set her right, but, so far as he could see, with
absolutely no result. He had simply wasted his time.
The doctrine of world effort, of world helpfulness,
of world responsibility, which he had preached with
such conviction, had fallen upon deaf or hostile
ears. So he preached it no longer. He was worn
out.</p>

<p>But what remained? Nothing that seemed to him
worth while. Oh, he could still bring some food to
Austria&#8217;s starving children; he could still help or
hinder the plans of a petty king; he could still take
France&#8217;s part in her struggle against isolation. But
other men could do that just as well as he.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would be better worth while if he could
make a woman happy; a woman whom no other man
could make happy....</p>

<p>But how imbecile to suppose there was such a
woman! And if there were, what had he to offer
her? To drag her down with him on his long descent?
No&mdash;that was a journey which he would
make alone!</p>

<p>And at this point he threw off the covers, bounded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
out of bed, rang for breakfast, and plunged into his
bath, which he made much colder than usual.</p>

<p>He needed bracing. He was getting soft.</p>

<p>After breakfast he settled resolutely to work on
the last of his Austrian articles&mdash;a summary of the
situation, not half so desperate as certain financiers
had pictured it, for nothing could deprive Vienna of
her position at the very centre of the system along
which flowed the trade of central Europe. He kept
doggedly at work until it was finished, and as he
read it over he decided that it was the best of the
lot. At least, he told himself, he had not forgotten
how to write!</p>

<p>So it was to a composed and apparently normal
Selden that the card of Mr. Charles Wharton Davis
was presently handed in, with that young gentleman
close behind it. It seemed to Selden, as he greeted
him, that his air was unusually subdued.</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t wait for me last night,&#8221; Davis began,
accusingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;did you finally break the bank?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn the bank! I want to talk to you seriously.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; fire ahead. But sit down, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Davis sat down and looked about the room for a
moment, as though trying to find a place to begin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had another talk with mother this morning,&#8221;
he said finally.</p>

<p>&#8220;About Miss Fayard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. She got quite violent&mdash;says she has other
plans for me&mdash;that she&#8217;ll tie up all my money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Selden, smiling. &#8220;She wants you
to marry the Princess Anna.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>&#8220;My God!&#8221; groaned Davis, his face turning pale
with horror. &#8220;That&mdash;that&mdash;why, she&#8217;s got a moustache,
Selden! No; I won&#8217;t do it! Look here,
you&#8217;ve got to help me. I&#8217;ve done my part.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose you tell me about that first,&#8221; Selden
suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it was just as I thought,&#8221; said Davis, disgustedly.
&#8220;Sis knew all about it. She fired up and
told me to mind my own business. None of my
family takes me seriously. Mother thinks this is
just a boy and girl affair. It&#8217;s not&mdash;I&#8217;m a man and
I&#8217;m going to be treated as a man!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a minute,&#8221; said Selden; &#8220;you&#8217;re getting
ahead of your story. Tell me exactly what you said
to your sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked her if she knew that Danilo had a morganatic
wife, because if she didn&#8217;t know it, I thought
it was my duty to tell her so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; and what did she say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She said of course she knew it; that that was all
arranged, and that she wished I would attend to my
own affairs, which certainly required my attention!
I said yes, I knew they did, and that if she wanted
to be a real sister to me, she&#8217;d help me out&mdash;that I&#8217;d
fallen in love with the sweetest girl on earth....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead,&#8221; Selden encouraged, as Davis paused.
&#8220;What did she say to that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She said &#8216;Piffle!&#8217; or something like that; and
then I got mad, and told her that she couldn&#8217;t fool
me&mdash;that I had seen through her from the start&mdash;all
that fol-de-rol about helping that little stinking
country out there&mdash;when her whole object was just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
to get even with Jeneski because he had thrown her
over....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a minute!&#8221; Selden interrupted, sitting bolt
upright. &#8220;What do you mean by that? Do you
mean that Jeneski and your sister were engaged to
be married?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no; I was just laying it on a little heavy.
But Jeneski and father were always chewing the rag
in the library of evenings, and sis used to hang
around and pretend she understood, and all she could
talk about was Jeneski and the wonderful things he
was going to do. She was certainly crazy about him.
And then all at once she shut up, and after a while I
learned that Jeneski had pulled out for Europe&mdash;so
I just put two and two together. But I may be
all wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did your sister say when you made this&mdash;er&mdash;accusation?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Davis, with a grin; &#8220;the door slammed
about then.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden sat for a moment looking at him. Could
this be the key to Myra Davis&#8217;s conduct? It fitted
certainly, or seemed to&mdash;and yet....</p>

<p>&#8220;So, since I couldn&#8217;t get any sympathy at home, I
came over here,&#8221; Davis concluded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you are not going to get much here,&#8221; said
Selden. &#8220;If you want to be treated like a man
you&#8217;ve got to act like one, and a man doesn&#8217;t drink
too much champagne whenever he gets the chance,
nor fool away his time at a roulette table, nor live
off of money somebody else has earned. I think it is
a good thing your money is tied up&mdash;maybe you will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
have to go to work. And I&#8217;ll never ask your mother
to turn it over to you&mdash;not till you have proved
there is something in you. I <i>might</i> ask her to allow
you something to live on till you can find a job, and
I <i>might</i> point out to her that Miss Fayard is a darn
sight too good for you, but not till you promise to
brace up!&#8221;</p>

<p>Davis&#8217;s face had darkened a little at the beginning
of this tirade, but it was radiant before Selden
finished.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do anything you say,&#8221; he protested. &#8220;I know
I&#8217;ve been a good deal of a rotter. Just give me a
chance!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Selden. &#8220;That&#8217;s exactly what
I&#8217;m proposing to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll go tell Cicette it&#8217;s all settled,&#8221; and
Davis jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you mean settled?&#8221; Selden demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to reform, and you&#8217;re going to see
Mother. That&#8217;s the bargain, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to see your mother <i>after</i> you have reformed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, this is after,&#8221; Davis pointed out with a
grin. &#8220;I reformed fully five minutes ago. Look
here, old man,&#8221; he went on more seriously, &#8220;don&#8217;t
think I&#8217;m not eternally grateful&mdash;I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up and get out!&#8221; Selden ordered. He was
beginning really to like the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come and have lunch with me,&#8221; Davis suggested.
&#8220;Maybe Madame Ghita will let me take
Cicette, if you&#8217;re along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Lord! I&#8217;ve an engagement for lunch!&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
and Selden jerked out his watch. &#8220;I can just make
it. Get out of here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Davis. &#8220;But remember, my
fate is in your hands!&#8221;</p>

<p>Half an hour later, Selden and Scott sat down
together at a little table on the terrace of Amiraut&eacute;&#8217;s,
among the olive trees, high above the sea, and attacked
a great dish of tiny sole, browned to a crisp
and unbelievably sweet and delicate, which Scott had
ordered. And after that there were tournados garnished
with slices of foie gras. And finally there was
a basket of fruit and nuts&mdash;figs from the oases of
the Sahara, grapes from Malaga, oranges from
Morocco, paper-shelled almonds and walnuts from
the Aur&egrave;s....</p>

<p>They had talked of desultory things, of old experiences,
during the meal; but with the coffee and
cigars, Scott brought the talk abruptly back to the
present.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything new about the restoration?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;except that I heard last night Jeneski is on
his way here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scott whistled softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you suppose he expects to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heaven knows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will stir up some excitement, anyway,&#8221; said
Scott. &#8220;I met him once&mdash;he&#8217;s an electric sort of
fellow; you can almost see the sparks flying when
he gets excited. And he will be excited all right&mdash;but
it seems to me the person to be pitied most in
this affair isn&#8217;t Jeneski or Miss Davis, but Danilo.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you pity him?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>&#8220;Well, if it was me,&#8221; said Scott slowly, &#8220;I
wouldn&#8217;t give up a woman like Madame Ghita&mdash;not
for any throne on earth. And neither would
you,&#8221; Scott added, looking at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; Selden agreed, gazing out
across the water; &#8220;not if she loved me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean she doesn&#8217;t love the prince? Well, I
suppose not. She is a very extraordinary woman.
She got me to talking about you last night,&#8221; he added
in another tone; &#8220;she wanted to know all about
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Selden; &#8220;she told me you had been
blowing off. I could see what you were trying to do.
I appreciate it, old man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scott nodded curtly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is finished, then&mdash;her affair with the prince?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine!&#8221; said Scott, and nodded again.
&#8220;What are you going to do, now you have finished
your Balkan stuff?&#8221; he asked, after a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I was thinking about it this morning.
The fact is, Scott, I have lost my edge. I&#8217;m
beginning to go downhill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; Scott protested. &#8220;Downhill! You
make me tired!&#8221; But there was a certain anxiety in
his eyes as he looked at Selden.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true, though. You know what I have been
working for and how I have failed. The League is
dead so far as America is concerned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyway, my people have intimated that I might
as well quit writing about it&mdash;nobody wants to read
that sort of stuff any more, it seems.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>Scott puffed his cigar reflectively for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m inclined to think you are right, old man, in
a certain sense,&#8221; he said at last. &#8220;As a special correspondent,
you have reached the summit&mdash;you can&#8217;t
go any higher because there is no higher place to
go to. But that doesn&#8217;t mean you are going to give
up fighting for the things you believe in. You have
a following&mdash;I don&#8217;t think you realize how large it
is; and right now is the time for you to strike out
for something bigger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Such as what?&#8221; asked Selden sceptically.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t thought it out&mdash;but what I see at this
moment is a great liberal weekly, with you as editor-in-chief
and the strongest kind of a staff&mdash;the kind
you could get together better than any other man I
know. I have thought for a long time that the day
of the literary monthly&mdash;the Scribner, Harper, Century
type&mdash;is about over, and that the time is ripe
for the liberal weekly, dealing in a large way with
world affairs and social progress and politics&mdash;and
art and literature too, of course. I know there are
already three or four, but they are all handicapped
by some sort of mental bias or astigmatism or spiritual
dyspepsia. Now is the time for the real thing.
And you are the man to start it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden laughed a little bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you were such a dreamer, Scott!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t a dream.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is. Apart from all question of myself,
where is the money to come from? You don&#8217;t
imagine it would be self-supporting?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not&mdash;not for a long time. It must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
have financial backing&mdash;the right sort&mdash;strong
enough to make it independent in every way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how can a liberal paper hope to get financial
backing? How can any paper get financial backing
without mortgaging its opinions? It can&#8217;t be
done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it can,&#8221; said Scott. &#8220;At least, I believe it
can. There must be one disinterested millionaire
somewhere in the world! I&#8217;ll take a look for him.
Meanwhile, there is another thing you want to do:
get married&mdash;to the right woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;ve already got her picked out for
me,&#8221; remarked Selden, with irony.</p>

<p>&#8220;As it happens, I have,&#8221; said Scott coolly. &#8220;I
was talking to her last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden stared at him, all his blood in his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean Madame Ghita?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I do,&#8221; Scott answered curtly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But look here,&#8221; Selden stammered, &#8220;you&#8217;re
joking, of course! Do you suppose I&#8217;d have the
nerve ... I&#8217;m not good enough for her ...
I&#8217;m not big enough....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you&#8217;re not,&#8221; broke in Scott impatiently.
&#8220;But that doesn&#8217;t matter, if you can make
her happy. Think what it would mean to live with
a woman like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Selden, between set teeth; &#8220;I have
thought....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And she could make any man big&mdash;if she loved
him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; agreed Selden hoarsely, &#8220;if she loved
him! She couldn&#8217;t love me!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; retorted Scott; &#8220;women do
strange things sometimes. Why not ask her?&#8221;</p>

<p>And he threw away his cigar and called for the
bill.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX<br />


A PHILOSOPHER DISCOURSES</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was not merely, or even principally, to arrange
the articles of settlement that the Baron
Lappo had gone so hastily to Paris. The
terms of the articles had already been agreed upon,
after exhaustive debates with Mrs. Davis&#8217;s solicitor,
tentative drafts had been exchanged, and the final
one was even then in the baron&#8217;s hands, with but a
minor detail or two needing correction&mdash;trivial matters,
easily arranged by post.</p>

<p>But the royal exchequer was low&mdash;empty, as a
matter of fact; and the need of replenishment was
so urgent that the baron had excused himself a few
minutes after Selden&#8217;s departure from the betrothal
dinner, changed hurriedly into travelling clothes
while his valet packed his bag, and had managed to
catch the Paris express.</p>

<p>He had reached Paris early the following afternoon,
had driven straight to the rooms of a private
banker in Rue Lafitte, who, forewarned by wire, was
awaiting him, and had at once, as was his habit,
placed all his cards on the table. These cards had
been examined carefully by a fat gentleman with a
black curly beard and a type of countenance unmistakably
Hebraic, and had proved so satisfactory that
the baron was able to get away at the end of an hour,
and to catch Mrs. Davis&#8217;s solicitor upon his return<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
from a leisurely lunch. The final details of the settlement
were soon agreed upon and arrangements
made to have the official copies prepared at once.</p>

<p>He had then spent an hour at the Quai d&#8217;Orsay,
and another half-hour at the British Embassy in Rue
du Faubourg St. Honor&eacute;; had gone back to Rue Lafitte
for a final talk with his banker, and then to the
offices of the solicitor in the Avenue de l&#8217;Op&eacute;ra,
where the official copies of the agreement were
awaiting him, and had arrived at the Gare de Lyon
in time to catch the train for Marseilles leaving at
8:50, very tired but triumphant.</p>

<p>It was about the middle of the next afternoon
that he stepped out again upon the platform at Nice,
entered the car which was awaiting him, and was
whirled away to the Villa Gloria, where he found
the king recovering from the heart attack of the
previous day.</p>

<p>It had been a severe one, brought on, as always,
by over-eating. The king was a gourmet, not to say
a glutton, with not always the strength to resist
temptation. It was one of Baron Lappo&#8217;s duties to
supply this strength. In his absence, the task usually
devolved upon the Princess Anna; but she had been
ill the day before, and the chef had been so ill-advised
as to prepare a rich pillaff of which the king
was very fond&mdash;with the consequence that for a time
he had been very ill indeed.</p>

<p>The baron uttered no reproaches, but there was
that in his look which would have made the king
blush, if he had not already been so rubicund.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not be cross with me, my old friend,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;It is the only pleasure I have left.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>&#8220;But at this moment,&#8221; the baron pointed out,
&#8220;Your Majesty should be very careful. It would be
most unfortunate if the impression got about that
you are subject to such attacks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not dead yet,&#8221; said the king; &#8220;though I confess
that for a time I was uncertain about it. You
have the papers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are here,&#8221; and the baron spread them out.
&#8220;Everything is as we wished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are the exact figures?&#8221; asked the king.</p>

<p>&#8220;The estate, when all the debts had been settled
and the taxes paid, amounted to seventy-five millions.
Of this a third was left to the daughter, a third to
the son, and a third to the wife, the wife&#8217;s share to
be held in trust, after her death, for any grandchildren.
The son&#8217;s share is also in trust; the
daughter&#8217;s is to be paid over to her upon her marriage,
but must remain her property, not her husband&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We cannot object to that,&#8221; said the king. &#8220;She
will have, then, how much?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About twenty-five million dollars, Sire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is how much in the currency of our country?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At present rates, nearly three billions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said the king thoughtfully, &#8220;what cannot
be done with such a sum! Half of it will suffice!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is also my opinion,&#8221; said the baron.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the remainder can be put aside as a foundation
for our house. If we could get the boy
also....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His money will never be really his&mdash;it is held in
trust for his children.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>&#8220;Magnificent!&#8221; said the king. &#8220;It would make
our house the richest in Europe. Yes, we must
arrange it. But meanwhile, my good Lappo, as
you know, we have nothing. Did you see
Hirsch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Sire; and he is willing to make a loan&mdash;three
hundred thousand francs, to be repaid one
month after the marriage. The terms,&#8221; added the
baron, &#8220;are rather stiff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter,&#8221; said the king, who was used to stiff
terms. &#8220;When can we get the money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have arranged for the notary and an official of
Hirsch&#8217;s bank to come this evening, prepared to pay
it over after Your Majesty and Danilo have signed
the necessary papers. Danilo must not fail to be
present.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said the king; &#8220;I will attend to that.
This does more to cure me than all the doctors,&#8221; he
added. &#8220;There is no illness so annoying as lack of
money! And the settlement&mdash;that also must be
signed without delay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had thought of to-morrow morning,&#8221; said the
baron.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; agreed the king; &#8220;you will make the
arrangements.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have also to report,&#8221; said the baron, &#8220;an attitude
of benevolent neutrality on the part of the
French and British governments. They have no disposition
to interfere, so long as there is no bloodshed.
Italy, of course, we can count on. Our
success, therefore, seems assured, unless the
prince....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not worry about Danilo,&#8221; said the king.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
&#8220;He will do as I tell him&mdash;he knows his duty. You
have provided for his wife?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have caused an offer to be made her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By whom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the Countess R&eacute;mond.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; said the king reflectively. &#8220;You think
you can trust her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely, Sire. She has reasons to be grateful
to me&mdash;and to hate Jeneski.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right not to count too much upon gratitude,&#8221;
said the king; &#8220;but hate&mdash;yes, that is better.
She is a clever woman. We must not forget her,&#8221;
and he turned to the papers on his desk.</p>

<p>The baron retired to his cabinet to look through
his mail, and there he found the report from the
countess of her interview with Madame Ghita, and
of her acceptance. But it contained no reference to
the receipt of the telegram from Goritza heralding
Jeneski&#8217;s arrival.</p>

<p>The baron read the report attentively, especially
a long postscript in which Selden&#8217;s name occurred,
and nodded approval once or twice. Then he ordered
his car, made a careful toilet and presently
sallied forth to call upon Mrs. Davis in her villa at
Cimiez; and, after a most satisfactory conversation
with her, directed his chauffeur to proceed by the
coast road to Monte Carlo.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Selden had declined Scott&#8217;s proffer of a lift back
to his hotel.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ll walk,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It will do me good.&#8221;</p>

<p>The moment had come when he must arrange his
future&mdash;when he must decide what he was going to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
do. He felt that he must be alone, that he could
not meet any of the actors in the drama&mdash;certainly
not Madame Ghita&mdash;until that decision had been
reached. And he was the prey of many and violent
emotions, for he began to perceive that the decision
might not rest wholly in his hands. Scott was a
fool, of course, in thinking there was any chance for
him; but at least he must make up his mind whether
he should try to win her or whether he should flee.</p>

<p>It was evident that his only sure safety lay in
flight; he could no longer trust himself; and he told
himself again and again that he was a fool to hesitate.
Yet to flee from such a woman&mdash;wasn&#8217;t that
more foolish still? The thought of life with her
turned him giddy, set his blood on fire....</p>

<p>But how could he support her? There was no admiring
public ready to pay for the privilege of dining
with a newspaper man! Even if he had been willing
to accept life on such terms. And she would have to
renounce the king&#8217;s bounty, for it was equally impossible
for him to live on money acquired as that
would be. But what right had he to ask her to do
that? What had he to offer in return? No, he
couldn&#8217;t do it! He must go away!</p>

<p>And then the memory of her eyes, of her voice,
rent him anew. He was in love! He! In love!</p>

<p>He stood away and looked at himself with a sneer.
What a pitiable object he had become!</p>

<p>Yes, he must go away&mdash;at once.</p>

<p>When he finally got back to his room, he hauled
out his bag and began to pack&mdash;slowly, with long
periods of abstraction.</p>

<p>It was thus the baron found him. It needed but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
a glance at Selden&#8217;s tortured face to tell that astute
old student of human nature what was amiss.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am back, you see,&#8221; he said, as he took the
proffered chair. &#8220;Everything is arranged, and I
have come to ask you to do Madame Davis and myself
one more favour. I have no shame&mdash;I am always
asking!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the favour?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The articles of settlement are to be signed to-morrow
morning. Mrs. Davis would consider it a
very great favour, and so should I, if you would sign
as a witness in her behalf.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing in the terms of the settlement
to which you could object,&#8221; went on the baron.
&#8220;The entire fortune of Miss Davis remains absolutely
in her hands. The prince gets nothing, except
a small annuity. We preferred it so. We hope, of
course, that she will choose to use a portion of her
fortune to rehabilitate our country&mdash;which will be
her country also&mdash;but the bulk of it will be conserved
for the benefit of her children.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still Selden hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; said the baron, &#8220;tell me frankly what is
in your thought.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am wondering,&#8221; said Selden, &#8220;whether Miss
Davis will be happy. It is evident that she is not in
love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not, at least, with the prince,&#8221; supplemented the
baron.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I may be wrong,&#8221; said the baron, &#8220;because I do
not understand your women; but I have observed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
Miss Davis as carefully as I could&mdash;naturally, since
I had need to do so!&mdash;and I have become more and
more convinced that somewhere in her life there has
been an unhappy love affair, from which she has
never quite recovered. That happens, does it not,
even to American girls?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course,&#8221; said Selden.</p>

<p>&#8220;I admit it does not seem probable, but it is the
only explanation I can find of a thing which has appeared
to me very strange. For the only question
she has asked herself, apparently, about this marriage
is not whether she would be happy, but whether
she would be useful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Selden again; &#8220;she asked me just
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for a moment, so far as I could see, has she
thought of love. That, I confess, seemed to me unnatural;
though perhaps American girls do not think
of love,&#8221; and the baron shrugged his shoulders helplessly.
&#8220;Or perhaps they are ashamed of it. I do
not know. As for happiness&mdash;are your American
marriages always happy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not always,&#8221; Selden admitted with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never seen one that appeared so,&#8221; said
the baron; &#8220;not as a French marriage is very often
happy. To me, American husbands and wives seem
merely bored with each other. Why should two
people stay together when they would be happier
apart?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see only the worst ones over here; and a lot
of people are held together by habit, by fear of ridicule
or loss of position. We are cowards in that
respect.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>&#8220;Yes; we are not like that. For one thing, our
women try to keep themselves interesting to their
men, and they are not ashamed of love. They do
not consider a husband merely a source of funds&mdash;a
bank. Very often they manage his affairs for
him, and better than he could. The attitude of the
husband, too, is different. With you, women are an
ornament; with us, they are a passion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too much so, perhaps,&#8221; commented Selden.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be; yes, no doubt our men are less faithful
than yours, but they are also less cruel. They do
not outlaw a woman because she has had a lover;
they do not regard her as therefore ruined. It was
Dumas&mdash;was it not?&mdash;who pointed out that a woman&#8217;s
virginity belongs, not to the first man who
possesses her, but to the first man she truly loves,
to whom for the first time she really surrenders&mdash;for
it is to him only she gives everything. Well, our
men believe that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Selden in a low voice; &#8220;yes....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And after all,&#8221; went on the baron, lighting
a cigarette, &#8220;it is a much greater compliment to
a man&mdash;a much more difficult thing to achieve&mdash;to be
a woman&#8217;s last lover than it is to be her first one.
To be a woman&#8217;s first lover&mdash;that is nothing; she is
curious, she wishes to know what love is, she has not
perfected her defence. A man needs only to be a little
good-looking and not too stupid. But to be her
last one, that is different. To emerge victorious
from the comparisons that she makes, to impress her
as no one else has done, to awaken something in her
that no one else has been able to awaken, to cause
her to say to herself, &#8216;I will seek no further&mdash;I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
content! I love him!&#8217; To accomplish that, a man
must be very clever, very intelligent. It is a triumph.
There is no higher tribute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it is a tribute Miss Davis will pay
the prince,&#8221; suggested Selden, with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was not thinking of Miss Davis,&#8221; said the
baron; &#8220;but it is possible. The prince is not without
brains. At least, I trust she will be happy as
well as useful. I give you my word, as a man of
honour, that I shall do everything in my power to
make her so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure of it,&#8221; said Selden; &#8220;and I shall be
glad to be present to-morrow morning as Mrs.
Davis&#8217;s witness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said the baron. &#8220;At eleven.&#8221;</p>

<p>He made a little motion as if to rise, then, glancing
again at Selden&#8217;s face, lighted another cigarette
and settled back in his chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me about yourself,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What has
been going on here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing has been going on. I have been doing
a little work&mdash;and annoying myself a great deal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Annoying yourself? About what, if I may ask?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About my future.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said the baron. &#8220;Does it not please you&mdash;your
future?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As a matter of fact,&#8221; answered Selden, with a
crooked grin, &#8220;I have suddenly discovered that my
future is behind me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The baron took a long puff of his cigarette and
exhaled the smoke slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Americanisms sometimes puzzle me,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;What you mean, I suppose, is that you do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
not at this moment see ahead of you any work which
seems as important as that which you have already
done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at this moment, or any moment. Worse
still, I am beginning to despair of human nature;
I....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you are wrong&mdash;very wrong,&#8221; broke in the
baron. &#8220;Here am I, with at least twice your age,
my whole life spent in the most cynical of all professions,
and my admiration for human nature grows
stronger and stronger, day by day. I listen to the
pessimists with a smile&mdash;the prophets of evil do not
frighten me. I grant all their contentions: that man
is naturally evil, that he has used such glimmering
light of reason as he may possess only to become
more bestial than the beasts, that five thousand years
of civilization have culminated in five years of
atrocity, fiendishness and insanity; yes, but in the
midst of it all, in the very worst of it, there were
flashes of splendour&mdash;flashes of kindliness, and courage
and self-sacrifice. There is something of that
in all of us&mdash;and that is the miracle. It should not
astonish us that men are full of ignorance and vice,
but that they are capable of the heroisms they sometimes
attain. You have been looking at the wrong
side of the shield, my friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I have,&#8221; agreed Selden, in a low voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, turn it over,&#8221; said the baron. He paused
a moment, evidently in doubt whether to go on. &#8220;I
am an old man,&#8221; he continued at last, &#8220;and I have
seen a great deal of life; also I esteem you very
highly&mdash;so you will permit me to say something
which in another might seem an impertinence. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
this: do not fear to seize happiness when it comes
your way; do not hesitate, or draw back, or run
away. It is a rare thing, happiness&mdash;a very rare and
fleeting thing; even at best, we can only hope to
taste it briefly now and then. How silly, how
cowardly to permit a single moment of it to escape!
That,&#8221; he added, &#8220;is all I have learned in the
sixty years that I have been on earth. But many
men do not learn even that&mdash;not until it is too late!&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat for a moment longer looking at Selden
with his wise old eyes; then he rose abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, my friend,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Till to-morrow&mdash;at
eleven.&#8221;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXI<br />


THE UNLIT LAMP</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was a decidedly nervous and shaken Selden
who dressed for dinner that evening. For the
first time in his life he had committed what is
for a journalist the unpardonable sin&mdash;he had permitted
his feelings to become involved in an affair
which he had set himself to watch from the outside.
He had ceased to be an observer and had become
a participant.</p>

<p>Yet permitted was scarcely the word, for he
seemed to have had no volition in the matter. He
had been drawn in against his will. But, he told
himself grimly, it was because his struggles to escape
had been half-hearted. He might have saved himself
had he heeded the first signals of danger. It
was his cursed inability to make up his mind that
had brought him to his present pass. He had dabbled
with temptation&mdash;and now it was too late: the
whirlpool had him!</p>

<p>No; that was not true either. Let him at least
be man enough to be candid with himself: he could
escape, even now, if he really wanted to. He had
only to finish packing his bag, go to the station, get
aboard the first train, and permit it to carry him
away. But that was such a cowardly thing to do.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>&#8220;Oh, own up, you idiot!&#8221; he groaned between his
teeth. &#8220;It&#8217;s not because it is cowardly you don&#8217;t
do it! Own up! It&#8217;s because you don&#8217;t want to
escape!&#8221;</p>

<p>And, staring at himself in the glass, he realized
that this was the truth&mdash;he had got down to it at
last. He didn&#8217;t want to escape. It was finished.
He might still struggle a little in an instinctive sort
of way, but unless some power outside himself
seized him and threw him clear....</p>

<p>Yes, and in that event he had the horrid consciousness
that he would fight with all his strength
against that power!</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it I am afraid of?&#8221; he asked himself.
&#8220;The baron is right. A man is a fool not to seize
happiness when it comes his way!&#8221;</p>

<p>If he could only have happiness without capitulation!
If he could have love fighting at his side for
some great ideal! That were to be blessed indeed.
But if love should drag him down&mdash;well, even then,
he would have love!</p>

<p>Why had the baron talked to him like that?
Was it, perhaps, that he had some inkling....
And old Scott, too....</p>

<p>The sharp ringing of his telephone bell startled
him out of his thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Davis,&#8221; said the voice at the other end.
&#8220;What are you doing to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing in particular,&#8221; Selden answered; the
only thing he had definitely planned was to go to
the club in the hope of finding Madame Ghita there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then come up and have dinner with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is &#8216;us&#8217;?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>&#8220;Madame Ghita, Miss Fayard and myself. We
are having a dinner to celebrate a very special
event&mdash;one in which you are particularly interested.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the prince?&#8221; asked Selden.</p>

<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t come until later&mdash;he just telephoned us
not to wait for him&mdash;he has to sign some papers of
some sort. Three would be deadly, and madame
suggested that I ask you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden&#8217;s heart was beating like a drum. It was
the Rubicon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the dinner?&#8221; he asked, in a voice muffled
by emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;In madame&#8217;s apartment, here in the hotel&mdash;third
floor. Will you come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please come, M. Selden!&#8221; said madame&#8217;s voice
softly.</p>

<p>It was all over&mdash;he took the plunge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I will come,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Thank madame
for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you can thank her yourself,&#8221; said Davis,
with a chuckle. &#8220;We will give you fifteen minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; Selden agreed, and placed the receiver
back on its rack.</p>

<p>He gave a last critical look at himself, retied his
tie, then caught up coat and hat, descended to the
lobby and hurried out to the florist&#8217;s at the corner,
where he bought two preposterously expensive
bunches of roses. He paid for them with a thrill of
satisfaction&mdash;for the first time in his life he was
being foolish; he had cut loose from the moorings
of common-sense; he had let himself go!</p>

<p>Flowers in hand, he hurried back to the hotel and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
presented himself at the door of Madame Ghita&#8217;s
apartment.</p>

<p>He was entirely cool, now; quite himself; and was
able to present the flowers to the ladies and exchange
the usual greetings without a tremor. Only he suspected
an uncanny discernment in the long look
Madame Ghita gave him as she thanked him for the
roses.</p>

<p>She was looking incredibly lovely in a clinging
gown of dark, wine-coloured velvet, without ornamentation,
and as she moved away from him to
place the roses in a vase and order dinner to be
served, he drank in again the exquisite grace of her
figure, the queenly pose of her head, the regal way
in which she moved. And a sudden shaft of fear
struck through him. How could he hope to win a
woman like that!</p>

<p>She came back in a moment, and motioned them
to table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us sit down,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You here at my
left, M. Selden; you at my right, M. Davis; you
there, Cicette.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they took their seats Selden saw that she had
placed one of his roses in her bosom, and his hands
began to tremble a little, in spite of his efforts to
control them. He was grateful that Davis was babbling
away excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was great for you to come, old man,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;perfectly gorgeous. Imagine a dinner with an
empty place!&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden chilled at the words. Yes, it was true; he
was there in another man&#8217;s place; this apartment
was another man&#8217;s apartment; this woman....</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>He had an impulse to rise&mdash;to run away. It was
not at table only he was seeking to take another
man&#8217;s place. The thought was almost more than he
could bear.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had a premonition the place would be empty
unless M. Selden consented to come,&#8221; said Madame
Ghita softly.</p>

<p>Davis stared at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you were doubtful if he would....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew that M. Selden had many engagements,&#8221;
said madame, her colour mounting a little. &#8220;Nevertheless,
I permitted myself to hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden felt his heart revive. So the place was
really his!</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very good to me, madame,&#8221; he murmured,
and then he caught Cicette&#8217;s eyes on him,
very round and shining. Well, let the whole world
see; he did not care!</p>

<p>But Davis was too engrossed in his own affairs to
notice anything.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you, you know,&#8221; he rattled on, &#8220;that this
was a very special occasion. Confound it, I can&#8217;t
keep it any longer!&#8221; he added, as Cicette made a
motion to silence him, and he caught her hand and
held it. &#8220;Waiter, fill the glasses! Selden, old man,
I want you to drink to the health of the sweetest girl
in the world&mdash;the future Madame Davis!&#8221; and he
raised Cicette&#8217;s hand to his lips with more grace than
Selden imagined he possessed.</p>

<p>&#8220;With all my heart!&#8221; cried Selden, deeply moved.
&#8220;I congratulate you, Davis; and you also, mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Davis, and held out his hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
across the board. &#8220;You said that as though you
meant to do it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do mean it. She is charming. She will make
you a good wife. Take care that you make her a
good husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that, the bride-to-be gave him her hand to kiss.
&#8220;You also are very charming,&#8221; she said in rapid
French, &#8220;and I hope that some day it will be my
turn to wish you good fortune.&#8221; She glanced at
Madame Ghita&#8217;s face, and suddenly sprang to her
feet and ran around the table and kissed her. &#8220;You
are a darling!&#8221; she whispered in her ear; &#8220;a big, big
darling, the dearest of the world!&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame held her close for a moment, and then
sent her back to her seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must be sensible,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I shall be sensible, do not fear,&#8221; Miss
Fayard assured her. &#8220;And I shall try to be, as you
say, monsieur, a good wife. But he has need of
control, has he not? A strong hand, hein?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Truly,&#8221; agreed Selden; &#8220;a very strong hand.
Do not hesitate to apply it, mademoiselle, right from
the beginning!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See here,&#8221; protested Davis, &#8220;don&#8217;t talk so fast.
Or speak English.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I also learn ze Eengleesh,&#8221; laughed Miss Fayard.
&#8220;Oh, already I spik heem verree well. But ees
eet not ridicule, ce nom-la&mdash;Madame Davees!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it is going to be yours,&#8221; said Davis grimly,
&#8220;so you&#8217;ll have to make the best of it. You understand,&#8221;
he went on to Selden, &#8220;this is between ourselves
as yet. We&#8217;ve got to square things with
Mother before it&#8217;s announced.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>&#8220;She will never consent, never!&#8221; cried Miss Fayard,
lapsing into her native tongue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, she will,&#8221; said Davis. &#8220;Old Selden has
promised to help me. And if she doesn&#8217;t, it won&#8217;t
make any difference. I&#8217;m of age. We won&#8217;t
starve.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden looked at him with interest; already he detected
in him a new spirit. He was more of a man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I will help,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but whether your
mother consents or not, you were right not to wait.
There is a very great English poet,&#8221; he went on to
Madame Ghita, &#8220;named Robert Browning&mdash;perhaps
you have heard of him&mdash;and he was a great
poet because he was first of all a great philosopher.
One of his poems is about a man who loved the wife
of another man, and she also loved him, and they decided
to go away together and be happy. But first
one thing intervened, and then another; the days
slipped by, and the months and the years&mdash;before
they knew it, age was upon them, their blood grew
cold&mdash;it was too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;and then?&#8221; asked Madame Ghita, who
had been listening with shining eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Browning points out that their indecision, their
cowardice, was far worse, far more damning, than if
they had seized their happiness, though that was a
crime, and he adds that a man should contend to the
uttermost for his life&#8217;s set prize, be it what it will&mdash;vice
or virtue&mdash;for the worst sin of all is &#8216;the unlit
lamp and the ungirt loin.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he is right,&#8221; said madame in a low voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course he is right&mdash;that is why I tell Davis
he is wise to seize his happiness while it is within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
reach. Whether his mother consents or not&mdash;that
does not matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it true, then, monsieur,&#8221; asked the girl, who
had been listening to all this with great eyes, &#8220;that
in America one can marry without the consent of the
parents?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But yes,&#8221; Selden assured her. &#8220;With us it makes
no difference whether or not the parents consent.
Many times they do not even know about it until
after their children are married.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is scarcely to be believed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;America, mademoiselle,&#8221; said Selden, whose
spirit had suddenly lifted its wings within him, &#8220;is
the land of youth, for youth, about youth. We are
young; we permit our young people to tyrannize over
us; our literature, our theatre, concerns itself only
with their love affairs, which are always innocent
and always end in a happy marriage. And in that
marriage it is always the woman who dominates.
The man is tolerated, because to a marriage a man
is necessary; but he has only one function&mdash;to provide
a pedestal upon which the woman may
stand; and but one duty, to worship her all his life.
He has promised to do so, and he must keep that
promise, no matter how silly and useless he may find
her to be. That is the convention, the proper thing,
to which all good Americans subscribe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know! I know!&#8221; cried Cicette. &#8220;I have seen
them&mdash;the man following his wife like a footman&mdash;a
beast of burden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Selden, laughing. &#8220;It is only in
America the woman walks in front.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there is one thing I cannot understand,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
went on Cicette, &#8220;that there are so many American
women who leave their husbands at home when they
come to Europe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; Selden demanded. &#8220;What need has
the husband of culture or relaxation? His function
is to earn the living.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But is it not dangerous? Those deserted husbands&mdash;do
they not find some one....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of them do&mdash;but most of them just keep
on toiling away. The American husband is incredibly
docile and incredibly faithful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I do well to marry an American?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he does well to marry a Frenchwoman,&#8221;
said Madame Ghita, &#8220;for, in spite of her gay manner,
in spite of her apparent thoughtlessness, she is
good and very serious at bottom. She will give herself
to her husband utterly, without reservation; she
will live only for his career; she will be ceaselessly
vigilant for his interests; if he is ill, she will nurse
him; if he has bad fortune, she will console him;
she will herself prepare the dishes he likes to eat,
happy to serve him....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Selden; &#8220;men are more precious
over here, more cherished. You have always had
more women than men. With us, as with every
frontier nation, it has been the other way&mdash;and we
still preserve the frontier tradition&mdash;it is the women
who are at a premium!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is deeper than that!&#8221; protested madame; &#8220;it
is in the heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We also have women like that,&#8221; said Selden
quietly; &#8220;women who would do anything for the man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
they love. You do not see them over here&mdash;not
often; they are too busy raising their children.
They do not figure in the papers, for their life is
spent in their homes. Only they demand more of a
man than you do. They do not realize what half-tamed
creatures we are, and sometimes they demand
too much. I think you understand men better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; laughed Miss Fayard, shaking her
finger at Davis. &#8220;We understand them! Never believe
that I will not understand you! When you lie
to me, I shall know it&mdash;but you will never suspect
that I know&mdash;not until long, long afterwards. And
then you will be very, very much ashamed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Davis, gazing at her in rapt
adoration. &#8220;I am not afraid! Isn&#8217;t she a peach?&#8221;
he added to Selden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exquisite!&#8221; Selden agreed, suddenly sober. &#8220;Be
good to her, old man!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to tell me that!&#8221; said Davis
quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not. What are you going to do after
you are married?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to take a trip around the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;and after that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, settle down somewhere, I guess, and raise a
family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will keep your wife busy, but not you.
What are <i>you</i> going to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will be a great politician!&#8221; cried Cicette.</p>

<p>Davis groaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in America!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is right,&#8221; said Selden, with a smile. &#8220;With<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
us it is not the same thing. Well, you must choose
a career for him, mademoiselle, after you know him
better; something to keep him busy part of the time,
so that he won&#8217;t be annoying you all day long. I
wish I had some one to choose a career for me!&#8221; he
added.</p>

<p>Madame Ghita looked at him quickly, struck by
something in his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have your career,&#8221; she said; &#8220;a very wonderful
one!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But of course! Every one thinks so!&#8221; She was
looking at him searchingly now, deeply concerned
at what she saw in his face. &#8220;Do you mean it does
not satisfy you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems rather empty at times,&#8221; he confessed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Empty? But how is that possible? Oh, you are
jesting!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish....&#8221;</p>

<p>A sudden commotion at the outer door interrupted
him&mdash;the sound of a raised voice; and then the curtains
were swept aside and Danilo burst into the
room.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come for you, R&eacute;nee!&#8221; he cried, with a
wild gesture. &#8220;Hasten&mdash;I take you away to-night!&#8221;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXII<br />


A WOMAN&#8217;S DECISION</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE was a moment&#8217;s stupefied silence,
while the prince looked triumphantly at
each of them in turn, his gaze lingering upon
Selden an instant longer than upon the others, as
though asking what he did there. His eyes were
shining strangely, and there was something defiant
in his face, something reckless in his air, as of a man
who had started forth upon some desperate venture
and burned his boats behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come!&#8221; he said again, as Madame Ghita made
no move.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I do not understand!&#8221; she protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have had enough of it!&#8221; said the prince, and
he filled himself a glass of champagne and gulped
it down. &#8220;I am treated as of no importance, as just
a pawn in a game which does not interest me. I am
told to do this, not to do that; to marry a woman
for whom I care nothing&mdash;that would not be so bad;
it was what I expected; to that I have agreed. But
to leave the woman I love&mdash;no, to that I did not
agree, and when they tell me I must do it, I say no,
it is not possible; it is asking too much! I rebel&mdash;yes,
I thrust it all aside, and I come to take you
away!&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame Ghita&#8217;s face was ghastly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>&#8220;But the dynasty&mdash;your grandfather; it will kill
him,&#8221; she said, in a voice hoarse with emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot help it. That is no reason why I should
be miserable all my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And your country?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jeneski will rule it better than I. Come! What
is it?&#8221; he demanded, seeing that she still stared at
him as though fascinated, and made no move.
&#8220;What is it you fear? That I have no money?
See here,&#8221; and he plunged his hand into his pocket
and brought forth a bulky purse. &#8220;I have three
hundred thousand francs&mdash;enough for two years!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you get it?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter where I got it!&#8221; he cried, and a little
spasm crossed his face, distorting it for an instant.
&#8220;I have it&mdash;that is enough. Come!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; she protested. &#8220;No, no! You cannot
do this!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; put in Davis, who had caught the
drift of things, &#8220;what about my sister?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your sister will be far happier if she does not
marry me,&#8221; said the prince. &#8220;I am not in the least
the man for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still,&#8221; protested Davis, &#8220;to be deserted like
this....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She may make any explanation she pleases&mdash;that
it was she who broke off the match&mdash;and I will confirm
it I have no wish to injure your sister, monsieur,
and she will not be injured.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just the same,&#8221; Davis muttered, &#8220;it&#8217;s pretty
tough that it should happen twice!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If monsieur wishes any other satisfaction,&#8221; said
the prince haughtily, &#8220;I am at his service.&#8221; Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
he swung back to Madame Ghita. &#8220;Alors, R&eacute;nee!&#8221;</p>

<p>The blood was coming back into her face and
she was regaining her self-control.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, Danilo,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and do not be so
ridiculous. One cannot go away like that. What
about my packing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your maid can do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&mdash;you are going away like that, with
just the clothes you have on?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My man will send my things after me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said; &#8220;you are too silly. You must keep
your word to this girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you told me to-day that, when I marry her,
everything is over between us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; everything is over between us now, Danilo,&#8221;
she said gently.</p>

<p>His face flushed a fiery red and he strode toward
her threateningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it is not because of this marriage that you
leave me&mdash;it is because you no longer love me!&#8221;</p>

<p>She made no answer, only looked at him, smiling
slightly, a bright spot of colour in either cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;You love some one else!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Who is
it?&#8221; and his eyes roved for an instant back to Selden&#8217;s
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Danilo,&#8221; she said sadly, &#8220;do not spoil everything
at the end in this way. Do not make me regret
that I have known you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it is true! Who is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur,&#8221; said Madame Ghita coldly, &#8220;I am
not to be shouted at, even by you. You are not
yourself to-night. If you are going to behave in
this manner, I must ask you to withdraw.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>For an instant, Selden, tense and ready to spring,
thought the prince was going to strike her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Withdraw!&#8221; he repeated, staring at her and then
about the apartment, as though doubting his own
senses. &#8220;You tell me to withdraw!&#8221;</p>

<p>And then he burst into a roar of laughter, pulled
up a chair and sat down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he said, lighting a cigarette with trembling
hand, &#8220;it is over. I was a fool, hein? What a
joke! Give me some wine!&#8221;</p>

<p>Davis, much relieved, filled his glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you often have these fits?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not often, monsieur,&#8221; said the prince drily, sipping
his wine. &#8220;Madame there can testify that I am
usually of the most equable. But sometimes&mdash;yes,
sometimes I think I am a little mad,&#8221; and he rubbed
his hand across his forehead. &#8220;Yet we are all of us
a little mad, are we not, M. Selden?&#8221; and he looked
at Selden with a sardonic smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some more than others,&#8221; Selden answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you mean me!&#8221; said the prince. &#8220;Yes, it is
so&mdash;I more than others. Sometimes I am quite,
quite mad. To-night, par example, I thought I had
discovered a way of escape from all the things that
worried me. That was mad, yes? Because one can
never escape!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; Selden agreed. &#8220;One can never
escape&mdash;not by running away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see what you mean,&#8221; and the prince nodded.
&#8220;To overcome one&#8217;s troubles, one must not run
away; one must face them, yes? Besides, it is
cowardly to run away, and a gentleman must not be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
a coward. You see I can be a philosopher at times&mdash;I
am at this moment, very philosophique. I remain&mdash;I
face my troubles. Monsieur Davis, you
will yet have me for a beau-fr&egrave;re! Madame, I ask
your pardon!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is granted,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am happy to see you
reasonable again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am reasonable,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;Another
glass!&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame, who had been watching him with evident
anxiety, shook her head, but Davis did not see
the gesture and filled the glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; said Davis, and refilled all the glasses.
&#8220;You remember I told you that I had a surprise for
you to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; smiled the prince. &#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is that I am going to marry Miss Fayard,&#8221;
answered Davis, unconsciously falling into his idiom.
&#8220;This is my betrothal dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it true?&#8221; cried the prince, and sprang to his
feet. &#8220;Monsieur&mdash;madame&mdash;let us drink to the
happy pair&mdash;to their health, to their happiness, to
everything that is good!&#8221; He drained his glass, then
walked around the table and took the girl&#8217;s hand.
&#8220;Mademoiselle,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I have always admired
you, for you are good. I pray you to accept this little
gift for good luck,&#8221; and he drew a ring from his
finger and slipped it upon hers, then kissed her hand
and released it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is beautiful!&#8221; she cried, holding it to the light.
&#8220;But it is your good-luck ring&mdash;you should not give
me your good-luck ring!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>&#8220;I shall not need it any more,&#8221; he said; &#8220;as p&egrave;re
de famille, I shall not tempt fortune. I shall just
grow fat and lazy.&#8221; He drew his coat about him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are going?&#8221; asked madame.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;I must be getting back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But is it true, Danilo, that you have all that
money in your purse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very foolish&mdash;and very dangerous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dangerous? In Monte Carlo, where one meets
a gendarme at every ten steps? Besides&mdash;do not
worry&mdash;I shall place it in the bank as soon as possible.
Unless&mdash;have you need of some?&#8221; and he
thrust his hand in his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, no!&#8221; she said quickly, with a gesture of repugnance.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is yours if you want it,&#8221; he persisted, his hand
still in his pocket, a strange smile on his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not want it,&#8221; she answered quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then good night,&#8221; said the prince. &#8220;You have
been very good to me, madame; I shall never forget
it, and shall wish you happiness always. And you,
monsieur,&#8221; he continued to Selden, &#8220;I regret that it
has not been my privilege to know you better&mdash;I
feel that we might have been friends. But I wish
you all good fortune.&#8221; He hesitated, his eyes on
Selden&#8217;s, as though debating whether to say something
more; then, with a little shake of the head,
turned to Miss Fayard. &#8220;And to you, mademoiselle,
again I say good luck. I am sure you will bring
good luck to others. How old are you?&#8221; he added,
as though struck by a sudden thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am nineteen, M. le Prince.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>&#8220;Nineteen&mdash;a good age&mdash;a lucky age!&#8221; he said,
and kissed her hand. &#8220;And you, M. Davis&mdash;but I
do not need to wish you good fortune&mdash;you have
it there,&#8221; and he nodded toward the girl. &#8220;Do not
worry, my friend&mdash;I will do my best to make your
sister happy. I can promise, at least, not to annoy
her. Good-bye!&#8221;</p>

<p>And with a wave of his hat, he was gone.</p>

<p>They all sat for a moment without speaking,
staring at the door through which he had vanished.
Then Davis reached for his glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he is mad,&#8221; he gulped. &#8220;But what does he
mean, going away like that? He&mdash;he frightens
me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Again there was a moment&#8217;s silence. Perhaps he
frightened all of them. Madame Ghita touched her
eyes gently with her handkerchief.</p>

<p>&#8220;He reminds me of a man about to go over the
top,&#8221; said Selden, pensively; &#8220;in a sort of ecstasy.
I have seen them like that many times, as they stood
waiting for the word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; cried Miss Fayard, with a catch in her
throat, &#8220;the word to go forward to their death!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not always death,&#8221; said Selden gently, his
heart very tender for the lovely sad woman beside
him. &#8220;Sometimes it is victory!&#8221;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII<br />


THE PRINCE PLAYS</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THEY still tell, at the Sporting Club, of the
last visit of Prince Danilo. There have been
other visits more spectacular, ending with a
pistol-shot on the terrace or a draught of poison in
the wash-room; but of them no one speaks. There
have been many persons who won more or lost more&mdash;and
were promptly forgotten. But there was
something about the prince that night, an air of mystery
and unreality, which the onlookers never forgot;
and his style was so exquisite, his bearing so perfect,
that they have ever since served as a model by which
the attendants measure each new aspirant for the
honours of the rooms. And all are agreed that they
have never been approached.</p>

<p>That visit, indeed, has not only been remembered,
but is rapidly passing into legend. Already it has
been richly embroidered, and reasons the most fanciful
have been advanced as to why the prince chose to
play a certain number, or why he chose to play at all,
and dazzling stories have been woven of what
would have happened if he had played at any other
table in the room, instead of the one he actually selected.
All of which is, of course, inevitable, because
the great diversion of the habitu&eacute;s of Monte
Carlo, aside from trying to devise a system to beat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
the bank, is explaining what would have happened
&#8220;if!&#8221; How many times daily the bank would be
broken but for that little word!</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, when the prince left the
Hotel de Paris, he probably did not expect to play
at all, for he asked the giant be-medalled negro who
keeps the door to call his car. The negro explained
respectfully that it was his infinite regret to be
obliged to inform M. le Prince that a slight accident
had happened to the car; a careless chauffeur,
in turning, had backed into it and damaged the front
axle slightly. Already it was being straightened in
the hotel garage, and would be ready in twenty minutes.
If M. Le Prince wished another car?</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the prince. &#8220;I will wait,&#8221; and he
walked slowly down to the terrace and stood for a
moment looking out to sea. A gardien saw and recognized
him, and saluted respectfully as he passed.</p>

<p>He might have stood there until the car was ready
but for a violent gust of rain which swept suddenly
in from the sea and drove him back up the steps.
At the top he hesitated. The lights of the Sporting
Club gleamed on his left, and at last he turned
slowly toward them. Perhaps it was in his mind
that, since the Goddess of Fortune had dealt him
one staggering blow that night, she might now, like
a true woman, relent and smile upon him.</p>

<p>At any rate, he mounted the steps to the entrance
and passed in.</p>

<p>The rooms were crowded, as always, and all the
tables were in play, but he passed through without
pausing or looking at any one, and walked on into
the buffet, where he ordered a whiskey and soda and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
drank it standing at the bar. Then, as though his
resolution was taken, he walked quickly back into
the gaming rooms, stopped at the nearest table,
changed a thousand-franc note for ten plaques, and
placed them around the number nineteen.</p>

<p>The chef de partie, sitting in his high chair behind
the croupiers and surveying the whole board, must
have sensed something unusual in the prince&#8217;s manner,
for he watched him intently, but no one else
paid any attention to him. Every one was absorbed
in the play.</p>

<p>An attendant asked him if he wished a chair, but
he shook his head and remained standing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Faites vos jeux, messieurs; faites vos jeux!&#8221;
called the croupier, and bets were placed up and
down the board, but the prince alone was on nineteen.
&#8220;Les jeux sont faits?&#8221; and the croupier leaned
forward, picked the little ivory ball out of the compartment
into which it had fallen the previous play,
gently reversed the motion of the wheel, and with a
quick snap of his middle finger sent the ball circling
around and around the cupped rim of the wheel&mdash;around
and around, six times, seven times, eight
times, and then its pace began to slacken.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rien ne va plus!&#8221; called the croupier sharply,
and the ball fell with a rattle into the middle of the
wheel, coasted up its raised centre, hesitated for the
merest instant, and settled with a quick snap into
one of the compartments.</p>

<p>&#8220;Le dix-neuf!&#8221; announced the croupier. &#8220;Rouge,
impair et passe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Breaths that had been held were released, and
there was a murmur of voices lamenting that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
had not been on nineteen. For the prince had won.</p>

<p>It was not very much&mdash;perhaps fifteen thousand
francs&mdash;but he seemed to regard it as a sign, for he
too took a quick breath and nodded to an attendant,
who hastened to find a chair for him. The prince
sat down, placed his winnings in front of him, and
began to play with absorbed attention, always on or
around or in connection with the number nineteen.</p>

<p>There have been many stories of desperate persons
who risked an entire fortune on a single turn
of the wheel and lost, or of lucky individuals
who won enormous sums by permitting their stakes
to accumulate as the same number came out again
and again. Neither of these things is possible, for
the bank sets arbitrary limits to the play, running
from a hundred and eighty francs on a number,
which pays thirty-five for one, to six thousand francs
on the simple chances, odd or even, red or black,
high or low, which wins an equal amount. So that,
if one plays the maximum on all the chances, it is
possible&mdash;though rather difficult&mdash;to lose about
thirty thousand francs, or to win a little over a hundred
thousand. But that is the limit.</p>

<p>So the prince, playing cautiously and confining
himself at first to the cheveaux and carr&eacute;s, took a
long time in losing the fifteen thousand francs he had
won, even though nineteen did not come again.
Twenty, seventeen and twenty-three came, which
helped to recoup his losses, and it was at least an
hour after he had sat down that the last of his fifteen
thousand francs were swept away.</p>

<p>He glanced at his watch and made a motion as if
to rise, then decided to wait for the next play.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>The ball fell into nineteen.</p>

<p>There was an outcry of sympathy and indignation
on the part of the spectators. What a shame,
what a crime, that his number should come at the
very moment he had ceased playing!</p>

<p>Quietly, as though moved by some power stronger
than himself, the prince drew his purse from his
pocket, opened it and laid it on the table before
him. And this time he staked the maximum.</p>

<p>It is not often that any one stakes the maximum at
Monte Carlo. Even in this day thirty thousand
francs is a considerable sum. So an electric whisper
ran around the room that something unusual was
going forward at the prince&#8217;s table, and the crowd
around it became thicker and thicker. The chef de
partie, scenting a battle royal, sent hastily to the
cashier for an extra supply of funds.</p>

<p>The hand of the croupier was perhaps a shade
less steady than usual as he picked up the marble
and started it on its run. It spun, faltered, rattled,
clicked....</p>

<p>&#8220;The twenty-seven,&#8221; announced the croupier.
&#8220;Red, odd and low.&#8221;</p>

<p>The prince had won six thousand and lost twenty-four.
Imperturbably he placed his bets again. It
was at this moment that Selden entered the room.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The prince&#8217;s abrupt departure had left a constraint
upon the dinner-party, which was not to be
shaken off. They had gone from the dining-room
into the salon, and there, after one or two ineffectual
attempts at gaiety, Davis and his fianc&eacute;e had withdrawn
to a corner sofa to discuss certain strictly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
intimate affairs, and Selden had smoked a cigarette
with Madame Ghita and talked of desultory and unimportant
things&mdash;of anything, indeed, except the
one thing which had been in his mind to say when
he was buying the roses.</p>

<p>Impossible to say that now&mdash;impossible even to
hint at it. It would be indecent&mdash;like wooing a
woman whose husband was dying in the next room!
Besides, she was in no mood for such confidences;
she was distrait and sad. The conversation faltered
and died away; and presently he summoned up
courage to take his departure. She had been obviously
grateful that he should go.</p>

<p>He was too depressed and agitated to think of
sleep, so he slipped into his coat, left the hotel and
descended to the terrace, just as the prince had done
half an hour before.</p>

<p>The rain-squall earlier in the evening had swept
the terrace bare, and he found himself alone there,
except for the gardien. Masses of slaty clouds were
fleeing across the sky before the gusty wind, with the
moon peeping between them now and then and sending
fugitive gleams of light over the white-capped
waves, which hissed and moaned dolefully as they
were driven in upon the rocky shore. More doleful
still was the rustle of the palms and the clatter
of the rubber trees flapping in the wind like a flock
of ghostly night-birds. And above him gleamed the
lights of the casino, standing like a courtesan, white
and gilt and laboriously gay, but at heart most dismal
of all!</p>

<p>Selden gave himself up for a time to the luxury
of self-pity&mdash;to that most dangerous of all dissipations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
a fit of the blues. What was the use of going
on? What was the use of having ideals or of fighting
for them? The world paid no heed. What, indeed,
was the world but a huge casino, where every
one was struggling to win his neighbour&#8217;s gold?</p>

<p>Why, above all, should he worry himself about a
woman who was sad because another man was leaving
her?</p>

<p>But here his sense of justice asserted itself. The
man was not leaving her&mdash;she was sending him
away. He had come seeking her and she had refused
to go. She had made her choice; but how
could she help being sad at the thought that one
epoch of her life was ended? She had lived with
this man in closest intimacy; he had no doubt been
kind and generous. He had loved her. At the end
he had come offering everything he had&mdash;and she
had sent him away. Where had he gone?</p>

<p>A sudden thought startled Selden out of his moodiness.
What had the prince meant when he promised
to give his money to the bank? Why had
he smiled so ironically? Which bank?</p>

<p>In a moment Selden was hurrying toward the
Sporting Club, and the instant he entered the rooms
he knew that his suspicion was correct. That dense
crowd around a single table could mean only one
thing&mdash;somebody was playing the limit.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is playing nineteen&mdash;always nineteen,&#8221; said
a man beside him to his neighbour.</p>

<p>Nineteen! Then of course it was the prince.</p>

<p>It was some time before Selden could get near
enough to see what was going on, but meanwhile
the marble had been spun twice and he heard the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
croupier announce two and eleven. Then he managed
to worm himself into a position from which
he could see the prince.</p>

<p>Danilo seemed entirely cool, nonchalant&mdash;listless,
even. He was smoking a cigarette and tossing his
notes into place upon the board as though they
were so many bits of worthless paper. He appeared
equally indifferent as to whether he won or lost, and
totally unconscious of the gaping crowd that watched
him. Selden recognized in his bearing the cold
fury of the confirmed gambler, which stops at nothing.
There had been in his head the idea that he
might intervene, but he saw that it was useless. To
speak to the prince now would be to insult him.</p>

<p>&#8220;The thirty-five!&#8221; announced the croupier.
&#8220;Black, odd and low.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, that was not so bad&mdash;six thousand on low
and six on odd. But the next number was six and
the board was swept clear again.</p>

<p>The prince proceeded calmly to renew his bets.</p>

<p>Nineteen must come sometime, Selden told himself.
If it came once, the prince would win back all
he had lost. If it came twice, he would be a hundred
thousand francs ahead.</p>

<p>Sixteen! That was good&mdash;thirty thousand
francs, nearly&mdash;a gain. But the next numbers were
fifteen, thirty-three, three and again six, and the
prince had lost another hundred thousand.</p>

<p>Nobody else was playing; it was a battle between
the prince and the bank. M. le Directeur des Jeux
had come out from his little office to watch it, and
to take command if necessary. The prince lighted
another cigarette and placed his money again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>Nineteen!</p>

<p>There was a little cheer from the crowd as the
croupier counted out the various bets one after
the other, and pushed the notes across to the
prince.</p>

<p>Again now! And every one pulled for nineteen
as the little ball spun gaily around. But it fell into
eight, and again the board was swept clean.</p>

<p>That was the beginning of a bad run; six&mdash;there
was a fatality about that six!&mdash;eight again&mdash;thirty-three&mdash;twelve&mdash;two&mdash;twenty-four&mdash;a
little gain there!&mdash;fifteen. And then there was a short rally:
sixteen&mdash;twenty&mdash;twenty-three; but never again
nineteen. Then another bad run, and the pile of
notes under the prince&#8217;s hand diminished rapidly.
He did not hesitate&mdash;always nineteen.</p>

<p>The crowd was beginning to get impatient with
him. Why nineteen? Why keep it up when he
saw it was not a good number? And as if to mock
him, the croupier at the next table could be heard
announcing nineteen! But certainly he should
change&mdash;if not the number, then the table. It was
imbecile to keep on like that!</p>

<p>But the prince did not change.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was nearly two o&#8217;clock when he finally put his
empty purse away and rose to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Messieurs,&#8221; he said, with a little bow to the
directeur and the chef de partie, &#8220;I have to thank
you for a very pleasant evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he walked calmly to the door, got his hat and
coat from the vestiaire, and went out into the night.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIV<br />


AN AFFAIR OF STATE</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SELDEN took train for Nice next morning with
a sense of impending calamity. He was greatly
depressed. The emotional events of the previous
evening had overtaxed his nerves. He had
slept badly, disturbed by elusively threatening
dreams, and his brain was muggy and distraught.
He was almost sorry he had not heeded his impulse
to run away&mdash;to leave his lamp unlit! He doubted
more and more whether its feeble rays would ever
guide him out of the labyrinth in which he was
madly wandering, and from which there seemed to
be no way of escape.</p>

<p>The train he had caught was a local, and as it
bumped its leisurely way along, he had time to review
his position over a contemplative pipe; but the more
he considered it, the worse it seemed to grow; turn it
as he might, he could discover no bright side. Of
one thing only he was certain: his life would never
again be the calm and satisfactory thing it had been.
A few days had changed it beyond recognition: it
was no longer simple: it was incredibly complex. He
could scarcely believe that only eighty hours had
elapsed since he had walked into the lounge of the
Hotel de Paris to meet the Countess R&eacute;mond.</p>

<p>At Nice, the passengers were hurried across the
tracks, for the Rome-Paris express had been signalled,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
and as he gave up his ticket to the guard at
the exit, Selden&#8217;s eye caught a familiar figure. It
was Halsey, walking nervously up and down in the
waiting-room, pausing now and then to watch the
people pouring from the train-shed. His eyes met
Selden&#8217;s for an instant, but he gave no sign of recognition.
He was rather a pitiable figure, his face
grey and drawn, his eyes shot with blood&mdash;evidently
his affair with the countess was not progressing
smoothly. Well, he was only getting what he
deserved, Selden told himself, as he turned away.</p>

<p>It still lacked fifteen minutes of the hour named
by the baron; so, deciding that the walk would do
him good, Selden turned briskly down the Avenue
des Victoires toward the sea. The street was
swarming, as usual, with tourists and winter residents,
whose presence there was always an insoluble
mystery to Selden. He never could understand
why any one would want to spend a winter at Nice,
when there were so many other places up and down
the coast infinitely more attractive. It was the herd
instinct, he decided, which brought these thousands
of people here to spend their vacations in an inordinately
expensive hotel or a dingy pension, with
nothing to do except walk up and down the Promenade
des Anglais, or look sadly on at the laboriously
manufactured gaieties.</p>

<p>He found the Promenade a solid mass of people
moving in two slow currents, one up, one down,
for this was the fashionable hour to get out and take
the sun and exhibit one&#8217;s new gown, which some man
somewhere had somehow procured the money for.
Truly, human nature is a curious thing!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>The gates of the Villa Gloria were open, and he
walked through, past the concierge, who recognized
him and touched his cap, up the path to the door,
where a waiting attendant received him and ushered
him at once into the salon.</p>

<p>The king and Lappo were already there and
greeted him warmly. Then the baron introduced
him to the notary, M. Noblemaire&mdash;a true type,
with hawk-nose, crinkly beard, and carefully brushed
clothes of rusty black&mdash;who, with an assistant, was
going over the papers to make sure that everything
was in order.</p>

<p>The prince came in a moment later, greeted Selden
casually, and sat down beside the long table which
occupied the centre of the room. He was dressed
in irreproachable morning costume and, save for a
slight pallor, gave no hint in his appearance of his
exciting experiences of the night before. No one
looking at him would have suspected that he had lost
a fortune! Selden was conscious of a great relief,
for he had expected he knew not what&mdash;some excitement,
some discomposure, at least some vestige
of wreckage after the storm. Certainly the prince
had consummate self-control!</p>

<p>Then the door opened and Mrs. Davis and her
daughter were shown in&mdash;the former very warm and
voluble, the latter as composed as the prince himself.</p>

<p>Nothing could have been more delicate, more exquisitely
attuned to the situation, than the way in
which Danilo greeted her, respectful, reserved, but
with just a hint of ardency beneath the surface.
From the quick glance she shot at the prince&#8217;s face,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
Selden inferred the manner was new to her, but it
was evidently not distasteful, and as he turned away
to meet Mrs. Davis, who was bearing down upon
him, he saw that the baron was contemplating it
with satisfaction. The prince had been tamed. He
was playing the game, and playing it extraordinarily
well!</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you do, Mr. Selden?&#8221; cried Mrs. Davis.
&#8220;It was <i>too</i> good of you to consent to be our witness.
I should not have dared to ask, but the dear
baron assured me that you were very good-natured....&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Davis came forward and gave him her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was nice of you,&#8221; she said; &#8220;and it relieves
my mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Relieves your mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled a little at his tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I regard it as the seal of your approval,&#8221; she
explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you still need the seal of my approval?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very comforting to have it. That is what
your being here means, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so; but you must remember that I am
looking at it from the outside, while you....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what you mean,&#8221; she said, as he hesitated.
&#8220;There is no reason why you should beat
around the bush&mdash;I am not a child!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course&mdash;but it has bothered me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It needn&#8217;t bother you any longer. It is all right.
I had a letter from her this morning&mdash;a very splendid
letter. Some day I should like to know her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Davis, to whom M. Noblemaire had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
presented, was announcing that Charley had stopped
for their notary, since it <i>was</i> necessary they have
their own notary.</p>

<p>&#8220;But surely, madame,&#8221; said M. Noblemaire, who
had some English. &#8220;Otherwise it would be most
irregular.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, so Charley had gone around for him, and
should arrive at any moment. And, sure enough,
at that moment Charley did arrive with another
notary in tow.</p>

<p>The two men of the robe greeted each other with
punctilious politeness. To look at them, no one
would have suspected that they played dominoes
together every evening at the caf&eacute; on the corner.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are all here, I think,&#8221; said the king, and took
his place at the head of the table. Baron Lappo
conducted Miss Davis and her mother to the seats
at the king&#8217;s right. The prince took his place at
his grandfather&#8217;s left, and their partisans ranged
themselves on either side below them. Selden found
himself near the foot of the table, facing M. Noblemaire&#8217;s
assistant.</p>

<p>For some minutes, there was a great rustling of
papers on the part of the notaries. Then they bent
their heads together across the table in earnest conversation,
while M. Noblemaire explained two or
three of the clauses to his colleague, who seemed to
be objecting to something, as a matter of form, no
doubt, to give the appearance of earning his fee,
but who finally nodded his head as though satisfied,
and settled back in his chair.</p>

<p>Then M. Noblemaire cleared his throat and rose
to his feet.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>&#8220;Mesdames et messieurs,&#8221; he began, speaking
in French, with a pronounced accent of the Midi,
and dwelling upon every syllable after the manner
of an orator, &#8220;we have come here to-day to sign
and to acknowledge certain articles of agreement
between the royal house of Ghita and the American
family Davis, which envisage the marriage of a
prince of that house with a daughter of that family.
With your permission, I will proceed to read those
articles.&#8221;</p>

<p>He adjusted his glasses and began to read, with
great care and solemnity, while his fellow-notary
followed on a duplicate copy, checking off the articles
one by one. Selden listened with deep interest.
He was gratified to hear the baron&#8217;s assertion
verified: Miss Davis&#8217;s fortune was to remain absolutely
in her hands, and was to descend to her children.
The necessity of children was recognized
quite frankly, and their status, rights, and privileges
were provided for in great detail. During the lifetime
of the king, he was to be their guardian jointly
with their mother. After his death, this duty was
to devolve upon the Baron Lappo. The prince was
to have a yearly allowance of two hundred thousand
francs and his present debts were to be paid. In
return, he engaged to reside within the borders of
his country for ten months of every year, unless his
presence elsewhere was necessitated by reasons of
state approved by the king.</p>

<p>Selden glanced up and down the board, as Noblemaire
read slowly on. The king and Lappo were
listening attentively, careful to let no word escape
them; the prince sat with arms folded and eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
downcast and face inexpressive, like a prisoner listening
while sentence was pronounced; Miss Davis
sat quietly attentive, her hands folded in her lap.
Her attitude seemed to say that, since this document
concerned her so closely, it behooved her to be
familiar with all its provisions, but it was a matter
of business, not of sentiment. Selden recalled the
baron&#8217;s words about her. Was it really some old
trial, some cruel disillusion, which had given her
this serene self-control? Had she really suffered
some disastrous adventure? It scarcely seemed
possible.</p>

<p>And then Selden remembered a sentence which
her brother had uttered, apparently at random, the
night before. It had passed unheeded then, but
Selden found that it had somehow stuck in his memory.
What was it he had said? &#8220;It&#8217;s pretty tough
that it should happen twice!&#8221; Something like that.</p>

<p>That what should happen twice? That she
should be twice deserted? For another woman?
Was it that old affair with Jeneski he referred to?
Had Jeneski deserted her for another woman&mdash;the
Countess R&eacute;mond? But the Countess R&eacute;mond
hated him too! She also was seeking to be revenged.</p>

<p>And suddenly the pieces of the puzzle fell together
in his mind like the bits of coloured glass in a
kaleidoscope, and he understood.</p>

<p>Jeneski was to be overthrown because two women
hated him; the destiny of a people was to be
changed, the course of history altered, to gratify
their vengeance.</p>

<p>Ah, well, that had happened a thousand times;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
women were always altering the course of history to
suit their whims or their passions; damming it up,
throwing it into strange channels....</p>

<p>Or perhaps it was only his too-fervid imagination
magnifying a chance remark. Myra Davis certainly
did not look like a girl to seek adventure, to court
disaster. At any rate, whether or not she had been
deserted once, she was not being deserted twice.
Presently she would be a princess, and after that
queen-regent. Her son would be a king&mdash;the first
king in history to be born of an American woman.
That, also, would alter its course!</p>

<p>M. Noblemaire&#8217;s voice droned on, and each of
them sat and listened and dreamed his dream; and
Mrs. Davis&#8217;s, perhaps, was the sweetest of all&mdash;of
a place on the steps of a throne....</p>

<p>Then suddenly the voice ceased and startled them
awake.</p>

<p>&#8220;You find it correct, I trust, monsieur?&#8221; inquired
M. Noblemaire of his fellow-notary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, monsieur; in every detail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we have only to sign,&#8221; said M. Noblemaire,
and turned to his assistant for the pens, ink
and blotter.</p>

<p>Selden was amused to see that the pens were long
quills.</p>

<p>M. Noblemaire dipped one of them in the ink,
picked up the paper, and approached the king.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will sign here, Your Majesty,&#8221; he said,
and laid the paper before him, indicated the place,
and handed him the pen.</p>

<p>The king scrawled a great <span class="allsmcap">PIETRO</span> across the page.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>It was the prince&#8217;s turn next, and the baron witnessed
the signatures.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, mademoiselle,&#8221; said M. Noblemaire, and
laid the document in front of Miss Davis.</p>

<p>She took the pen from him with a hand that shook
a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; cried a voice outside. &#8220;It is impossible,
monsieur; you cannot enter! Monsieur....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I must enter!&#8221; cried another voice, and the
door was thrown open with a crash.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXV<br />


THE COURSE OF HISTORY</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FOR a moment no one stirred&mdash;just sat and
stared at the man who came, swift and resolute,
into the room, while the frightened
attendant goggled from the door behind him&mdash;a
man of perhaps forty, with dark, vivid face, outlined
by a little beard, and a mop of black hair falling
over his forehead, and deep-set eyes gleaming
under heavy brows&mdash;a man with a bearing indescribably
confident and audacious; just sat and stared as
he advanced quickly to the table, bowed to Selden
and to the Baron Lappo, and then went straight to
Myra Davis, took her hand&mdash;dashing to the floor
the pen he found in it&mdash;and drew her to her feet,
against his breast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little one,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I have come for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>But she held him away from her&mdash;held him away
with arms trembling and convulsive, but inflexible;
and there was something like terror in her eyes as
she looked at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;You are horrible to
come here like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I love you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is too late!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not too late! Why is it too late?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>&#8220;Because&mdash;I do not&mdash;love you any more!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; he asked calmly, without any motion to
release her. &#8220;Of course&mdash;in that case....&#8221;</p>

<p>But by this time the king was on his feet, his face
purple.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this farce?&#8221; he roared. &#8220;Jacopo&mdash;Mario&mdash;throw
this fellow out!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One moment, sir,&#8221; said the stranger. &#8220;Perhaps
the Baron Lappo will do me the honour to
present me.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the Baron Lappo, his face a study, rose in
his turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; he said, &#8220;this is M. Jeneski.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jeneski. Selden, of course, had recognized him,
and Mrs. Davis, too, apparently, from the energy
with which she now rushed forward, rescued her
daughter from his grasp, and tried to kill him with
a look. But to the king it was undoubtedly a blow,
and for an instant his hand fumbled at his breast.
Yet not for nothing had the old warrior reigned for
sixty years in the midst of hate and violence, and
his composure was back in a moment. He signed to
Jacopo to close the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. Jeneski,&#8221; he said, with a bow, &#8220;I have often
wished to meet you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must apologize for my abrupt entrance,
sir,&#8221; said Jeneski, smiling his appreciation of the
king&#8217;s aplomb, &#8220;but I feared that I should be too
late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too late for what, sir?&#8221; asked the king.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too late for this ceremony,&#8221; explained Jeneski,
with a gesture toward the papers on the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said the king, &#8220;you wish to witness it?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>&#8220;I wish to prevent it,&#8221; corrected Jeneski quietly.</p>

<p>The king wrinkled his brow incredulously, and
his colour heightened a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really,&#8221; he began.</p>

<p>&#8220;Believe me, sir,&#8221; said Jeneski quickly, &#8220;I deeply
regret this violent and dramatic procedure. I assure
you that it is not at all in my character, but I
had no choice. I have strained every nerve to reach
here at the earliest possible moment. I should have
arrived last night, but was delayed by a series of
misadventures which I will not weary you by reciting.
So when, twenty minutes ago, at the villa of
Madame Davis, I learned of this conference, I could
only hasten here and force my way in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may as well force your way out again,&#8221;
broke in Mrs. Davis, who had listened to all this
with a face even redder than the king&#8217;s. &#8220;If you
think for a minute my daughter will have anything
to do with you....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, mother,&#8221; whispered the girl, her face
convulsed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I confess,&#8221; said the king politely, &#8220;that I do not
understand. Is it that you profess to have some
claim upon this young lady?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only the claim of a man who loves her,&#8221; said
Jeneski humbly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Love!&#8221; began Mrs. Davis, violently.</p>

<p>But again her daughter stopped her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am at a very great disadvantage,&#8221; went on
Jeneski. &#8220;It is very difficult to speak&mdash;to explain&mdash;to
say what I have to say thus publicly. If I for
one moment might see Miss Davis alone....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221; cried her mother.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>His eyes implored the girl, but she turned her
face away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; he said, and drew close to her side.
&#8220;I must speak to you then, little one, as though we
were alone. Forget that there is any one present
but you and me.&#8221; His voice was trembling with
emotion. He paused an instant to collect himself
and moistened his lips nervously. &#8220;Before I say
anything else, I must say this: for the wrong I did
you in a moment of madness I have suffered much.
Perhaps if you knew the whole story&mdash;but no; there
is no excuse. I say to you only that I have suffered,
that I have done great penance. All that
was torn out of my life and cast aside many months
ago. Since then I have thought only of my country
and of you. The baron can tell you that this is
true&mdash;since he has used that old affair to secure an
accomplice in the plot against me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was staring at him with wide-open eyes, white
to the lips, her hands pressed against her heart.
He made no motion to touch her, but his eyes never
wavered from hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even then,&#8221; he went on rapidly, &#8220;I would not
have dreamed of coming near you&mdash;no, not yet. I
would have worked on for my country and cleansed
myself with sacrifice&mdash;loving you always and hoping
that some day you might find me worthy; but this,
this alliance&mdash;it must not be! Do you know what
you are doing? You are riveting again on half a
million people the shackles they have just thrown
off after a struggle of two centuries....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are willing to leave it to the people themselves,
sir,&#8221; put in the baron quietly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; cried Jeneski, &#8220;after you have corrupted
them with I know not what promises! Of
course they will choose the easy way!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; said the baron.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are not fit to choose&mdash;not yet. Let them
learn first what freedom means. Come&mdash;I ask nothing
for myself&mdash;nothing,&#8221; he went on, turning back
to the girl. &#8220;I have no right to ask anything for myself.
Do I not know it? Yes&mdash;better than any one.
But for my country I do ask&mdash;I have the right to ask;
not much&mdash;only this: that you delay this marriage
for a year&mdash;for six months, even&mdash;<i>then</i> leave it to
the people....&#8221;</p>

<p>He had raised his arms in his excitement, and as
he brought them down with an impassioned gesture,
there was a spatter of blood across the papers on
the table, and a steady drip, drip from under his
sleeve and across his left hand to the floor.</p>

<p>He seized his left arm near the shoulder and held
it tight.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; asked Myra Davis, taking a
quick step toward him. &#8220;Are you hurt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is nothing,&#8221; said Jeneski impatiently; &#8220;less
than nothing; just one of the misadventures which
delayed me.&#8221; Then a little smile flitted across his
lips, and he looked at the baron. &#8220;I confess, however,
that I did not suppose the Baron Lappo would
descend to methods so&mdash;so primitive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, sir?&#8221; demanded the baron.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it not you,&#8221; asked Jeneski, still smiling,
&#8220;who posted that big Englishman on the platform
up yonder to shoot me as I left the train?&#8221;</p>

<p>The baron&#8217;s face was livid.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>&#8220;M. Jeneski,&#8221; he began, &#8220;I swear to you....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was not the baron,&#8221; put in Selden quickly.
&#8220;It was the Countess R&eacute;mond. I knew she was
driving Halsey on to something&mdash;but I never
guessed....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well, I should have guessed,&#8221; said Jeneski.
&#8220;I apologize to you, M. le Baron. After all, it is
nothing&mdash;a scratch across the arm. I had time to
bandage it but hastily, so it bleeds a little. I am
sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s pause. Then Myra Davis
released herself from her mother&#8217;s grasp and turned
to Baron Lappo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it true,&#8221; she asked, &#8220;what he said about that&mdash;that
affair?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, mademoiselle,&#8221; answered the baron grimly.
&#8220;It is true.&#8221;</p>

<p>The colour had come back into her face and her
eyes were shining.</p>

<p>&#8220;And is it true that you have suffered?&#8221; she asked
of Jeneski.</p>

<p>He made a little motion with his hands, more expressive
than any words.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have suffered, too,&#8221; she said simply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my love,&#8221; said Jeneski, humbly, &#8220;some day
I hope you will find it in your heart to pardon me!&#8221;</p>

<p>She stood yet an instant looking at him, then she
held out her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I pardon you now!&#8221; she said.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was over. The Davises were gone, and Selden
too had tried to go, but the baron had asked
him to remain.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>The king had behaved magnificently. Well he
knew the folly of trying to argue with a woman&#8217;s
heart, and he had uttered no word of disappointment
or reproach. Instead, having thrown and lost, he
took defeat like a sportsman and a gentleman, faced
ruin, exile, tragic failure, with a smile; had even
wished her happiness and kissed her hand in farewell.
With Jeneski he had been almost cordial.</p>

<p>Selden had never admired him so much, though
he told himself it was this very habit of dissimulation
which rendered the king least admirable.
Perhaps he had not yet lost hope&mdash;some fanatic
with a better aim than poor, fuddled Halsey might
take a shot at Jeneski&mdash;or there was the countess
herself, presumably raging somewhere at the failure
of her plot. There was still that possible alliance
between young Davis and the Princess Anna.
Finally there was always that huge sum which had
been offered for his abdication; which he had once
refused, but which he could still accept whenever it
seemed wise, and upon which he could live comfortably
for the remainder of his life. No doubt it was
such considerations as these which enabled the king
to bear up so well.</p>

<p>Selden was surprised to note that Danilo seemed
far more deeply affected. He was like a man
stunned; slouched forward in his chair, staring at
the papers with the dash of blood across them, his
face ghastly in its pallor.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must consider,&#8221; said the baron, &#8220;how best
to announce this to the world. M. Selden, I am
sure, will not wish to do us any unnecessary injury.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>&#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; said Selden. &#8220;I shall use only
the official version.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not conceal from you,&#8221; went on the baron,
&#8220;that this&mdash;d&eacute;b&acirc;cle I think I can call it&mdash;has left us
in a somewhat delicate position. We had made
certain financial arrangements, based on this alliance,
which will have to be cancelled, or at least reconsidered.
Fortunately....&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated, glancing at the king.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the king nodded, &#8220;I have not touched the
money since I placed it in my bureau last night. It
can be returned if Hirsch demands it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is that fact alone,&#8221; the baron pointed out,
&#8220;which saves us from the most painful embarrassment.&#8221;</p>

<p>The prince stirred uneasily, passed his hand
across his haggard forehead, and rose unsteadily
to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will excuse me,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The king nodded and the prince went slowly out.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not suppose it would be such a blow to
him,&#8221; said the king, as the door closed behind
Danilo. &#8220;I do not understand it. Unless he has
been losing again&mdash;but he has no money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; agreed the baron; &#8220;and I know of no way
he could secure any.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden managed to keep an impassive face, but
he was smiling inwardly. Evidently the prince had
sources of supply unknown to the baron.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever it is,&#8221; said the king, &#8220;let us hope it
will make him more serious. Continue, baron.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>The baron paced up and down for a moment, his
chin in his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course she will marry Jeneski,&#8221; he said, at
last, and glanced at his master.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I understand, Lappo,&#8221; said the king quietly.
&#8220;You would say that it is finished&mdash;that the game
is up. Well, we shall see&mdash;I have confidence in my
star! At least ... what was that?&#8221;</p>

<p>From somewhere in the house had come a muffled
report as of a door slamming&mdash;or a pistol-shot....</p>

<p>A sudden pallor swept over the king&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Danilo!&#8221; he cried, and started to rise, then sank
back clutching at his breast. &#8220;Danilo!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But Danilo lay sprawled across his bed, a bullet
through his heart.</p>

<p>He had managed to escape, after all!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVI<br />


A LAST ENCOUNTER</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;SINCE this is our last night in Paris,&#8221; said
Selden, looking up from his paper, &#8220;we ought
to celebrate it. What shall we do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The opera,&#8221; replied R&eacute;nee instantly. &#8220;Let me
see what it is,&#8221; and she took the paper away from
him.</p>

<p>It was Samson and Delila.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the curtain is at eight,&#8221; she added. &#8220;We
must hurry!&#8221;</p>

<p>They were there when the curtain rose, and
were soon under the spell of the enchanting music
with which Saint-Sa&euml;ns has clothed the old Scripture
allegory of man&#8217;s weakness and woman&#8217;s perfidy&mdash;a
drama which is re-enacted daily wherever men and
women live, and so touches a chord in every heart.
Surely no lovelier song was ever written than Delila&#8217;s</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Mon coeur s&#8217;ouvre &agrave; ta voix comme s&#8217;ouvrent les fleurs</div>
<div class="indent">Aux baisers de l&#8217;aurore....</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;My heart opens at thy voice as the flowers open
to the kisses of the dawn....&#8221;</p>

<p>And no more effective scene was ever staged than
that of the blinded Samson, chained like a beast to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
the mill, and pushing it round and round. So the
great drama swept on to the supreme moment when
Samson, praying for strength, bends his back between
the mighty pillars of the temple and brings it
crashing down upon the heads of his enemies.</p>

<p>There was to be a ballet afterwards to a Chopin
suite, and when Selden and his companion came back
from a turn in the foyer, they found that the front
row of the orchestra, which had been empty during
the opera, was filling up with distinguished-looking
old men, most of them with the rosette of the Legion
gleaming red on their coats.</p>

<p>R&eacute;nee nodded toward them with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; she said; &#8220;it is as I told you. They
come for the ballet only. But look&mdash;who is that?
Is it not the Baron Lappo?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it is,&#8221; said Selden, and they watched him take
his seat, a little thinner, perhaps, with the passage
of the months, a little greyer, but still erect, alert.
&#8220;I wonder what he is doing in Paris? Shall we waylay
him after the ballet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, let us. There are so many things I should
like to ask him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I also,&#8221; said Selden, and then fell silent, for the
music had begun.</p>

<p>There is nothing lovelier to be seen anywhere
than that Chopin suite as danced at the Paris
Op&eacute;ra....</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you regret that it is not you?&#8221; asked Selden,
as the tall and willowy Ida Rubenstein came forward
again and again to acknowledge the applause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the slightest&mdash;not the smallest bit,&#8221; and she
nestled against his shoulder. &#8220;I know too well what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
is behind the scenes. Besides, I could never have
been like that&mdash;I was not a great dancer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selden put his hand over hers and held it tight.
He could never get over his astonishment at the
thought that this magnificent woman loved him, was
his....</p>

<p>&#8220;We must hurry,&#8221; she added, &#8220;if we are going to
catch the baron.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a moment here,&#8221; said Selden, &#8220;and I will
go around and get him. I should like to surprise
him&mdash;I don&#8217;t think he knows.&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded, and he hurried away to the door by
which the baron would emerge into the foyer. Yes,
there he was&mdash;not changed; and yet changed, too,
in some subtle way&mdash;clouded, a little sad, with the
lines about the eyes a trifle more pronounced.</p>

<p>Selden&#8217;s heart moved curiously, as he watched him
coming forward; he had never before realized how
fond he had grown of the old diplomat.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear baron,&#8221; he said, and stepped forward
with hand outstretched.</p>

<p>The baron adjusted his glass and looked to see
who it was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it is M. Selden!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;My dear
friend!&#8221; and he caught Selden&#8217;s hands in both of
his and shook them up and down, his face irradiated.
&#8220;How glad I am to see you again! Come&mdash;we
must have a talk&mdash;yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By all means! But first I want you to meet
some one,&#8221; and he caught the baron&#8217;s arm and
guided him to the spot where R&eacute;nee waited.
&#8220;Baron,&#8221; he said, &#8220;permit me to introduce you to
my wife.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>&#8220;Your wife!&#8221; The baron&#8217;s lips were trembling
as he pressed them to R&eacute;nee&#8217;s hand. &#8220;Tiens!&#8221; and
he dropped his glass and polished it vigorously.
&#8220;But, my dear children&mdash;how happy you make me!
I should like to embrace you! I am a silly old man&mdash;yes?&#8221;
and he touched his handkerchief to his eyes
without shame. &#8220;But you recall so many things!
Where shall we go? We cannot talk here. To
Rizzi&#8217;s&mdash;it is but a step!&#8221; and seizing an arm of
each, he led them down the great stairway and across
the square, talking in broken sentences all the way.</p>

<p>Monsieur Rizzi knew the Baron Lappo, and he
snatched the reservation card from a glass on the
corner table and seated the baron and his guests
there, and himself took the order.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see,&#8221; said the baron, &#8220;you used to have
a Mo&euml;t et Chandon, very dry....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, the &#8217;98,&#8221; said M. Rizzi. &#8220;We still
have a few bottles, M. le Baron.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is foolish at my age, at this hour,&#8221; said
the baron; &#8220;but never mind; and a little lobster,
yes? with mayonnaise. I have not forgotten your
mayonnaise. And afterwards&mdash;what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Permit me,&#8221; said M. Rizzi; &#8220;a surprise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; agreed the baron; &#8220;I am sure it
will be a delightful one.&#8221; And then as Rizzi
hastened away to make sure that the order was
properly executed, the baron turned back to his
guests. &#8220;Now let me look at you,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Madame, I have never seen you so lovely, so radiant.
And you also,&#8221; he added to Selden; &#8220;you
also appear content!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Content is a feeble word!&#8221; said Selden.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>&#8220;So&mdash;it is well! But would you believe, madame,
that I one day found this great imbecile in his room
at Monte Carlo, trembling with fear, packing his
bag, even; planning to run away&mdash;to run away from
a great happiness. Incredible, is it not? But men
do stupid things like that sometimes, and women,
too, though not so often. So, because I had grown
fond of him, I ventured to give him some advice....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which I followed,&#8221; said Selden.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have not been sorry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just the same,&#8221; went on the baron, &#8220;you are not
worthy of her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Lord, don&#8217;t I know it?&#8221; groaned Selden.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t I wake up every morning in a panic for fear
it is only a dream!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fi donc!&#8221; laughed R&eacute;nee. &#8220;How silly you both
are!&#8221;</p>

<p>The waiter had filled the glasses, and the baron
lifted his from the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Words are so weak to express what is in the
heart,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I am sure you know what is in
mine&mdash;every wish for your happiness and your good
fortune&mdash;and may you always love each other!&#8221;</p>

<p>They drank, and set the glasses back upon the
table, and there was a little silence.</p>

<p>Then M. Rizzi brought the lobster for the baron&#8217;s
approval, and himself proceeded to dismember
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is something else that I recall very
vividly,&#8221; went on the baron; &#8220;that day, when I
found you so depressed, there was another thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
that worried you&mdash;how did you say it?&mdash;that your
future was behind you! Is it still there, or is it in
front, where it should be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is in front again,&#8221; said Selden with a smile,
&#8220;due also to this wonderful woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not have it!&#8221; cried R&eacute;nee. &#8220;It was M.
Scott&#8217;s idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it was you who found a way to realize it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It needed but a word!&#8221; she protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please tell me about it,&#8221; said the baron, who had
watched this altercation with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was like this,&#8221; R&eacute;nee explained. &#8220;It is true
that at one moment this imbecile was so stupid as
to think his career ended. He permitted himself to
become discouraged because he could not, all at once,
persuade his country to think as he did&mdash;to make it
think, as he calls it, internationally.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is something no country does,&#8221; observed
the baron. &#8220;Perhaps it will come some day, but
I am not at all hopeful. The better we know other
peoples the less we seem to like them. But go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was M. Scott&mdash;a friend&mdash;who proposed the
idea of an organ&mdash;a journal, you understand, hebdomadaire&mdash;where
he could gather together a band
of fanatics like himself and keep on fighting for his
beliefs. The idea appealed to him&mdash;he began to
think that, in control of such a journal, he might
find life again worth living.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So he doubted, did he, that life was worth living?&#8221;
commented the baron. &#8220;Even when he
had you? It is easy to see that he is an American!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; Americans are like that. They have something,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
I know not what&mdash;an engine&mdash;a dynamo&mdash;inside
them, driving them on. I doubt if they are
ever really happy, as a Frenchman can be happy&mdash;entirely
happy and content. At least, not for long;
they feel they must be doing something.&#8221;</p>

<p>The baron nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right. What is M. Selden going to
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has his journal!&#8221; cried R&eacute;nee and clapped
her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; laughed Selden, &#8220;she got it for me, much
as she would buy a toy for a child, to keep it quiet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how?&#8221; asked the baron.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, it was simple,&#8221; R&eacute;nee explained. &#8220;The
only difficulty, it seemed, was one of finance. You
remember that young M. Davis?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You knew, by the way, that he had married my
niece, Mlle. Fayard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But certainly!&#8221; laughed the baron. &#8220;That was
another of my defeats. The Princess Anna is still
a spinster&mdash;though she also has become a bride&mdash;but
of the church. M. Davis is happy, I trust?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; but he also is an American&mdash;though
not so earnest a one as my husband here. Nevertheless
he wished to find something to do&mdash;some way
to employ his money&mdash;a way that would amuse him
and not be too fatiguing. I had only to suggest the
journal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is going to be rather wonderful,&#8221; said Selden,
his eyes shining. &#8220;I have been in New York all
summer making the arrangements; I was astonished
at the enthusiasm; I shall have a splendid staff, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
perhaps we shall accomplish something yet! But
before I started it, I came back for this lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now you are returning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;we sail to-morrow on the <i>Paris</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is good,&#8221; said the baron. &#8220;But come&mdash;let
us drink to the journal&mdash;that it may accomplish
all you hope for it! Yes,&#8221; he went on after a moment,
&#8220;I am glad you are going back&mdash;though that
means that I shall, perhaps, not see you again, for
I am growing old. But it is not well for an American
to stay too long in Europe. It is difficult for me
to explain just what I mean. It is like an apple,&#8221;
and he picked one up from the basket of fruit on the
table. &#8220;One gathers one&#8217;s crop of apples and one
puts them away for the winter, and some of them
keep very well. But others, after a time, begin to
show little specks here and there. That does not
hurt them&mdash;indeed, it improves their flavour&mdash;but
they must be used at once. Otherwise, almost before
one knows it, they grow rotten at the core and
have to be thrown away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Americans are like that. They do not keep well
in the atmosphere of Europe. It is good for them,
yes, up to a certain point. They grow a little
specked, perhaps, but their flavour is better, more
rich, more satisfying. But beyond that&mdash;no. Forgive
me,&#8221; he added, carefully replacing the apple.
&#8220;An old man likes to preach. Ah, here comes the
surprise!&#8221;</p>

<p>M. Rizzi&#8217;s surprise proved to be a souffl&eacute; piping
hot with an ice in the middle.</p>

<p>&#8220;But tell us about yourself,&#8221; said Selden. &#8220;What
are you doing in Paris?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>&#8220;It is a long story,&#8221; answered the baron musingly.
&#8220;After the king&#8217;s death&mdash;which, as you know, was
very sudden&mdash;I felt as you had felt&mdash;though with
much more reason&mdash;that I was finished, that there
was nothing left for me to do but to creep away
somewhere and die. Then Jeneski sent for me.
He asked me to be his minister in place of one whom
he had discovered to be a traitor to him. And I
found that I still loved my country. We get along
very well together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And his wife?&#8221; asked R&eacute;nee, her eyes shining.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has already become a sort of saint to her
people; they adore her, and they have reason to,
for there is no country in Europe which progresses
as ours does. She is very happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever heard from the Countess R&eacute;mond?&#8221;
Selden asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not directly; but I believe she is in Budapest
plotting to place Charles back on the throne. It
seems she has a passion for restorations. That
poor M. Halsey has been released, as perhaps you
know. He was sent to a maison de sant&eacute; for a
time, but Jeneski refused to press the case.&#8221;</p>

<p>They sat silent for a moment with full memories
and tender hearts. Then the baron looked at his
watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is good to be here,&#8221; he said; &#8220;it renews my
youth. But I must go. M. Rizzi,&#8221; he added to
the bowing restaurateur, &#8220;permit me to compliment
you upon this little supper. I have never tasted
better mayonnaise, and your surprise was exquisite.
No&mdash;I shall not need a cab&mdash;I have but a step to
go.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>They passed together into the street.</p>

<p>&#8220;My hotel is just there,&#8221; said the baron. &#8220;So I
shall bid you good-bye.&#8221; He looked at them for
a moment pensively. &#8220;The French have a proverb,&#8221;
he added, &#8220;&#8216;To part is to die a little!&#8217; It is
true, especially for the old. Write me sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we shall!&#8221;</p>

<p>They watched him as he walked away&mdash;a gallant
figure, defiant of the years. At the corner he turned
and waved his hand. Then he was gone.</p>

<p>Selden raised his hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope,&#8221; he said softly, &#8220;that some day I shall
meet another man like that!&#8221;</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

        works.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
